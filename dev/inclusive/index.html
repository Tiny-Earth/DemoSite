Consequently, more than half of the 600,000 US students who declare STEM majors change to a different major before graduating (<a href="../refs/#thiry_talking_2019">Thiry <em>et al.</em>, 2019</a>), with students from underrepresented backgrounds switching out of STEM at disproportionate rates (<a href="../refs/#riegle2019does">Riegle-Crumb <em>et al.</em>, 2019</a>).</p><p>When students feel a sense of belonging in STEM, they are more likely to engage deeply, persevere through challenges, and envision themselves as future scientists, engineers, and innovators. And reversing STEM attrition requires us to reimagine how the various components of a classroom work together to create inclusive learning environments.</p><h2 id="A-Framework-for-Inclusive-Learning"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#A-Framework-for-Inclusive-Learning">A Framework for Inclusive Learning</a><a id="A-Framework-for-Inclusive-Learning-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#A-Framework-for-Inclusive-Learning" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>The Five Dimensions of Inclusive Teaching (<a href="../refs/#bell2016design">Bell <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>) provides a framework for understanding how instructors, students, curriculum, and pedagogy collectively influence our teaching, students’ learning, and the classroom environment.</p><p>At the center of the framework is course climate, which encompasses the atmosphere and environment in which students learn.

It is shaped by a combination of instructor decisions,  student interactions, and broader influences. As instructors, we play a key role in shaping this climate by designing and sustaining learning experiences to be welcoming and inclusive (<a href="../refs/#dewsbury2019inclusive">Dewsbury and Brame, 2019</a>; <a href="../refs/#bell2016design">Bell <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>). An inclusive course climate ensures that all students, regardless of background or identity, feel valued and supposed in their learning (<a href="../refs/#brame2019science">Brame, 2019</a>).</p><h3 id="The-Instructor-Dimension"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Instructor-Dimension">The Instructor Dimension</a><a id="The-Instructor-Dimension-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Instructor-Dimension" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Even though we are scientists, we are human and therefore not objective. As instructors, our identities are influenced by our values, principles, families, scientific disciplines, privileges, struggles, and all the factors that we experience during our lives (<a href="../refs/#rus2013teachers">Rus <em>et al.</em>, 2013</a>; <a href="../refs/#peterson1999institutional">Peterson <em>et al.</em>, 1999</a>). Those influences also give us biases that lead to assumptions. </p><p>In aggregate, our identities, biases, and assumptions affect the pedagogical choices we make regarding the content and examples we highlight, as well as the values and skills we expect our students to learn. As a result, the instructor shapes the course climate and therefore each student&#39;s learning experience. </p><h3 id="The-Student-Dimension"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Student-Dimension">The Student Dimension</a><a id="The-Student-Dimension-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Student-Dimension" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Like instructors, students come to our courses with a composite of identities, biases, and interests. Students interact with their instructors, with each other, and with  content in the context of a course’s climate. Students’ identities and their interactions influence the extent to which they feel a sense of belonging, which affects learning outcomes and persistence in STEM.</p><h3 id="The-Curriculum-Dimension"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Curriculum-Dimension">The Curriculum Dimension</a><a id="The-Curriculum-Dimension-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Curriculum-Dimension" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Curriculum is arguably the most visible component of a course and has an important influence on the course climate. It encompasses what we teach, including the learning objectives we set, the content we prioritize, how we demonstrate relevance, and the examples we choose to include. In STEM, this includes establishing which facets of science (described in the previous module) are most relevant for a specific course and working to bring them to life. Creating an inclusive course curriculum also involves considering whose interests and voices are represented.  </p><h4 id="Science-Content"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Science-Content">Science Content</a><a id="Science-Content-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Science-Content" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Many studies demonstrate that active participation in science leads to an improved sense of belonging and retention in STEM (<a href="../refs/#estrada2011toward">Estrada <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>; <a href="../refs/#evans_functional_2021">Evans <em>et al.</em>, 2021</a>; <a href="../refs/#hanauer_inclusive_2017">Hanauer <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>; <a href="../refs/#jordan_broadly_2014">Jordan <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>; <a href="../refs/#lopatto_genomics_2008">Lopatto <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>; <a href="../refs/#olson_expression-based_2019">Olson <em>et al.</em>, 2019</a>; <a href="../refs/#shaffer_course-based_2014">Shaffer <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>; <a href="../refs/#waddell_flying_2021">Waddell <em>et al.</em>, 2021</a>). This active participation requires that students engage with the six facets of science (described in the previous module). Our role as instructors is to establish which facets are most relevant for a specific course and work to bring them to life. The Scientific Teaching Course provides tools for this purpose in the following modules about course design and learning experiences.</p><h4 id="Diverse-Perspectives-and-Representations"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Diverse-Perspectives-and-Representations">Diverse Perspectives and Representations</a><a id="Diverse-Perspectives-and-Representations-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Diverse-Perspectives-and-Representations" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Part of scientific identity includes seeing one’s self and perspectives represented positively through the research questions asked, the outcomes discovered, and the individuals represented as scientists. Instructors decide whose voices are represented—which are all powerful ways to influence belonging in STEM. Strategies can be relatively simple, such as recognizing scientists from a variety of identities and backgrounds (<a href="../refs/#schinske2014teaching">Schinske and Tanner, 2014</a>), or complex, such as decolonizing the curriculum, which involves reimagining content and approaches that have historically prioritized Western, white, male-centric knowledge (<a href="../refs/#gichuru2024enhancing">Gichuru, 2024</a>). </p><h3 id="The-Pedagogy-Dimension"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Pedagogy-Dimension">The Pedagogy Dimension</a><a id="The-Pedagogy-Dimension-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Pedagogy-Dimension" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Pedagogy involves the teaching approaches that are used, including how students interact with the content and each other. Once again, the choices we make determine how inclusive the course feels. In the Scientific Teaching module, we demonstrated how poor instruction leads to a pattern of exclusion from STEM that differentially affects students. In contrast, pedagogies that promote a sense of belonging lead to increased persistence in STEM (<a href="../refs/#estrada2011toward">Estrada <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>), especially for HEC students (<a href="../refs/#evans_functional_2021">Evans <em>et al.</em>, 2021</a>; <a href="../refs/#hurtado_diversifying_2009">Hurtado <em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>; <a href="../refs/#olson_expression-based_2019">Olson <em>et al.</em>, 2019</a>; <a href="../refs/#rodenbusch_early_2016">Rodenbusch <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>; <a href="../refs/#shuster_implementing_2019">Shuster <em>et al.</em>, 2019</a>; <a href="../refs/#waddell_flying_2021">Waddell <em>et al.</em>, 2021</a>).</p><h2 id="Inclusive-Learning-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Inclusive-Learning-in-Practice">Inclusive Learning in Practice</a><a id="Inclusive-Learning-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Inclusive-Learning-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Let’s examine how the instructor, student, curriculum, and pedagogy dimensions work together to create a course climate that is welcoming and supportive of all students. Below is a summary of several evidence-based practices based on the five dimensions of inclusive teaching, many of which are expanded upon in subsequent modules.</p><h3 id="Choose-Evidence-based-Interventions"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Choose-Evidence-based-Interventions">Choose Evidence-based Interventions</a><a id="Choose-Evidence-based-Interventions-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Choose-Evidence-based-Interventions" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p><img src="../assets/five-dimensions-of-inclusive-teaching-hori.svg" alt="Illustration of the five dimensions of inclusive teaching, with a focus on dimensions dealing with evidenced-based interventions: curriculum, climate, and pedagogy."/></p><p>Interventions can be incorporated as individual or repeated activities, such as:</p><ul><li>Increase <strong>instructor presence and connection to students</strong> by making eye contact, engaging in positive body movements such as nods and smiles, communicating goals, setting guidelines for student interactions, and encouraging student participation (<a href="../refs/#shea2006study">Shea <em>et al.</em>, 2006</a>; <a href="../refs/#baker2010impact">Baker, 2010</a>; <a href="../refs/#andersen1981three">Andersen <em>et al.</em>, 1981</a>; <a href="../refs/#arbaugh2006does">Arbaugh and Hwang, 2006</a>).</li><li>Use <strong>active learning experiences</strong>, in which students actively engage with content and sometimes each other (<a href="../refs/#freeman_active_2014">Freeman <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>). You’ll find more examples in the Learning Experiences module.</li><li>Do regular <strong>formative assessments</strong>, in which students have the opportunity to regularly practice and receive feedback (<a href="../refs/#black1998assessment">Black and Wiliam, 1998</a>). You’ll find more examples in the Learning Experiences module.</li><li>Encourage <strong>microaffirmations</strong>, which are actions that demonstrate care and can affirm a student&#39;s capabilities (<a href="../refs/#estrada2019influence">Estrada <em>et al.</em>, 2019</a>)</li><li>Leverage activities that <strong>increase resilience</strong> by reframing social adversity as common and transient (<a href="../refs/#walton_brief_2011">Walton and Cohen, 2011</a>)</li><li>Incorporate interventions that make explicit the <strong>utility value</strong> of a course or its parts (<a href="../refs/#harackiewicz_closing_2016">Harackiewicz <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>; <a href="../refs/#asher2023utility">Asher <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>).</li><li>Take actions that mitigate <strong>stereotype threat</strong>, which occurs when individuals fear they may confirm negative stereotypes about their social group, which in turn can negatively impact their performance (<a href="../refs/#Steele2002-pt">Steele <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>).</li><li>Highlight <strong>scientists from a variety of identities</strong> and backgrounds (Schinske and Tanner, 2014), and present a range of research questions and discoveries so students can see themselves and things they care about reflected in the course. </li></ul><p>Instructors can also modify overall course structure or infuse practices into an entire course to accomplish an inclusive learning environment. Some examples:</p><ul><li>Create a culture where <strong>failure is a productive and normal part of science</strong>, rather than a judgement on students&#39; identity (<a href="../refs/#petroski2013success">Petroski, 2013</a>; <a href="../refs/#simpson_failure_2017">Simpson and Maltese, 2017</a>; <a href="../refs/#lopatto2020facilitating">Lopatto <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a>; <a href="../refs/#gin2018students">Gin <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>; <a href="../refs/#good2012women">Good <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>; <a href="../refs/#koch2008women">Koch <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>; <a href="../refs/#cacciotti2015fear">Cacciotti and Hayton, 2015</a>).</li><li>Use <strong>high-structure course design</strong> to elucidate what is expected of students and create predictable patterns (<a href="../refs/#freeman_increased_2011">Freeman <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>; <a href="../refs/#theobald_active_2020">Theobald <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a>). You’ll find more on this in the Course Structure module.</li><li>Engage students in the <strong>six facets of science</strong> (described in the previous module). Many studies demonstrate that active participation in science leads to an improved sense of belonging and retention in STEM (Estrada et al., 2011; Evans et al., 2021; Hanauer et al., 2017; Jordan et al., 2014; Lopatto et al., 2008; Olson et al., 2019; Shaffer et al., 2014; Waddell et al., 2021). </li><li>Teach a <strong>course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE)</strong>, in which students engage in research while enrolled in a course (<a href="../refs/#aikens_race_2017">Aikens <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>; <a href="../refs/#dolan_guide_2021">Dolan and Weaver, 2021</a>; <a href="../refs/#hurtado_diversifying_2009">Hurtado <em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>). </li><li>Leverage <strong>universal design for learning</strong> principles, which incorporate accessibility considerations into course design that provide equal access and opportunities for everyone, regardless of their abilities (<a href="../refs/#burgstahler2013universal">Burgstahler, 2013</a>).</li><li>Design <strong>authentic assessments</strong> that engage students in tasks that reflect how science is done in the workforce and in real-world contexts (Wiggins, 1990; Schultz et al., 2022; Villarroel et al., 2018). </li><li><strong>Decolonize the curriculum</strong>, which involves reimagining content and approaches that have historically prioritized Western, white, male-centric knowledge (Gichuru, 2024).</li></ul><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Commit to Action: Inclusive Learning</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>Describe 2-3 new actions you could take to promote inclusive learning in your course.</p></div></div><h3 id="Consider-Identities"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Consider-Identities">Consider Identities</a><a id="Consider-Identities-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Consider-Identities" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p><img src="../assets/five-dimensions-of-inclusive-teaching-vert.svg" alt="Illustration of the five dimensions of inclusive teaching, with a focus on dimensions dealing with identities: instructors, climate, and students."/></p><p>Identity comprises the social, emotional, and professional attributes of an individual (<a href="../refs/#rus2013teachers">Rus <em>et al.</em>, 2013</a>; <a href="../refs/#peterson1999institutional">Peterson <em>et al.</em>, 1999</a>). It can be influenced by life experiences, positionality, and power. Identity affects how we choose to present ourselves, relate to others, and prioritize content, which in turn, influences the learning climate.</p><p><strong>Social identity</strong> is defined as the sense of self that comes from membership in a social group and the value attached to membership within that group by society (<a href="../refs/#tajfel1979individuals">Tajfel, 1979</a>). It can change over time and between contexts (<a href="../refs/#gee2000identity">Gee, 2000</a>). Moreover, each of us holds multiple social identities that intersect to shape our unique experiences, both in how we see ourselves and how others see us (<a href="../refs/#crenshaw2013demarginalizing">Crenshaw, 2013</a>; <a href="../refs/#gordon2008ghostly">Gordon, 2008</a>). Although social science research has historically highlighted discrimination against protected social groups, it is also important to recognize the full picture of what it means to &quot;belong&quot; in a group, such as its members&#39; unique joys, values, experiences, and means for fighting back against their discrimination (<a href="../refs/#tuck2009suspending">Tuck, 2009</a>). Otherwise, we risk portraying these groups only ever in terms of their &quot;damage.&quot;</p><p><strong>Emotional identity</strong> characterizes how a person responds to their own emotions and the emotions of others. It is informed by experiences, power dynamics, and agency.</p><p><strong>Professional identity</strong> (in our case, teacher identity or STEM instructor identity) encompasses how individuals perceive themselves and construct their professional identities as teachers within educational settings (<a href="../refs/#yuan2019confrontation">Yuan <em>et al.</em>, 2019</a>). An instructor’s professional identity is dynamic and influenced by experience and positionality (<a href="../refs/#sachs2005teacher">Sachs, 2005</a>).</p><h4 id="The-Connection-between-Identity-and-Belonging"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Connection-between-Identity-and-Belonging">The Connection between Identity and Belonging</a><a id="The-Connection-between-Identity-and-Belonging-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Connection-between-Identity-and-Belonging" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Students’ identities influence the extent to which they feel a sense of belonging. The Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influence (TIMSI) explains the psychological mechanisms underlying belonging in STEM (<a href="../refs/#estrada2011toward">Estrada <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>). The TIMSI describes three orientations that contribute to student persistence in STEM:</p><ul><li><strong>Scientific self-efficacy:</strong> Students feel capable of performing the actions needed to be successful in science.</li><li><strong>Scientific identity:</strong> Students perceive science as part of who they are and feel a sense of belonging within a scientific community.</li><li><strong>Scientific values:</strong> Students authentically agree with the values of the scientific community, such as the importance of rigor and discourse in evaluating evidence.</li></ul><p>Considering students&#39; needs and backgrounds can help instructors to design learning experiences that build students&#39; confidence in scientific skills, affirm their identities as scientists, and highlight the relevance/importance of scientific values.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Identity Attributes</h4><p>Sort the following into social, emotional, and professional attributes of identity:</p><ul><li>ability</li><li>age</li><li>current state of mind</li><li>educational background</li><li>first-generation status</li><li>gender</li><li>mental health status</li><li>neurodiversity</li><li>overall health and well being</li><li>positionality within an institution</li><li>race/ethnicity</li><li>sexual orientation</li><li>skills and abilities</li><li>socioeconomic status</li><li>support network</li><li>trauma history</li><li>veteran status</li><li>work experience</li><li>work-related interests</li></ul><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click here to show the answer</summary><div class="admonition-body"><p>SOCIAL: race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, ability, veteran status, neurodiversity</p><p>EMOTIONAL: trauma history, mental health status, current state of mind, support network, overall health and well being</p><p>PROFESSIONAL: educational background, first-generation status, work experience, work-related interests, skills and abilities, positionality within an institution</p></div></details></div></div><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Reflection: Your Identity in Teaching Science</h4><p>Your identity matters.

Biases and assumptions matter, too. For example, biases and assumptions affect how we rate people, which can have consequences for hiring decisions and advancement.</p><p>Let’s examine hiring studies as one example of bias affecting outcomes. In one study (<a href="../refs/#Moss-Racusin2012-cm">Moss-Racusin <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>) 127 biology, chemistry, and physics faculty at six top US research universities received a student resume for a lab manager position. Each resume was randomly assigned a gendered name: “Jennifer” (female) or “John” (male). Otherwise, the applications were identical, and each evaluator saw only one version. Faculty then evaluated the student’s competence and hireability and proposed a salary.</p><p>What results would you predict?

Scales range from 1 to 7, with 7 being the highest score."/></p><p><img src="../assets/salary.png" alt="Science faculty provided higher salary offers for male applicants than women for a lab manager position (p &lt; 0.01). The gender of the reviewer did not affect scores or salaries. Both men and women faculty scored women students lower and offered lower salaries."/></p><p>Dozens of studies have compared hiring decisions with the same setup, all yielding the same result: Evaluators are substantially more likely to hire and pay a higher salary if an applicant has a man’s name. <strong>These results have not changed for 50 years.</strong></p><p>In fact, we hold biases about everything imaginable—not just hiring. For a more complete list of the HEC groups affected by bias and assumptions in STEM higher education, check out the supplementary materials for Achieving STEM Diversity: Fix the Classrooms (<a href="../refs/#handelsman_achieving_2022">Handelsman <em>et al.</em>, 2022</a>). An example in a classroom context could look like instructors calling on students they expect will have the right answer or whose name they can pronounce. </p><p>Bias is not inherently bad and is part of human nature. But when bias leads to recurring, systemic inequalities that cause negative socioeconomic impacts and structural inequities, we need to pay attention and effect change. </p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Reflection: Bias in STEM</h4><p>What biases have you seen or experienced in STEM or STEM higher education?</p></div></div><p>Some examples of strategies that consider the instructor and student dimensions include: </p><ul><li><strong>Learn about your students</strong> interests, goals and needs through short surveys and polls throughout the semester (Tanner, 2011; Tanner 2013).   </li><li>Create a culture where <strong>failure is a productive and normal part of science</strong>, rather than a judgement on students&#39; identity (<a href="../refs/#petroski2013success">Petroski, 2013</a>; <a href="../refs/#simpson_failure_2017">Simpson and Maltese, 2017</a>; <a href="../refs/#lopatto2020facilitating">Lopatto <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a>; <a href="../refs/#gin2018students">Gin <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>; <a href="../refs/#good2012women">Good <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>; <a href="../refs/#koch2008women">Koch <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>; <a href="../refs/#cacciotti2015fear">Cacciotti and Hayton, 2015</a>).  </li><li>Incorporate interventions that make explicit the <strong>utility value</strong> of a course or its parts, such as asking students to reflect on how course topics are relevant to their own goals, values and interests.
