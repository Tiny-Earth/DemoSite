teaching methods. In fact, the number of choices can be overwhelming. This module distills evidence-based practices that support an inclusive course climate and gives you the chance to evaluate them for your course. It also asks you to consider how your identities and actions influence who feels included or excluded in your course. The examples provided in this module are not comprehensive; many more can be found throughout this Scientific Teaching Course. </p><hr/><h2 id="Why-Inclusive-Learning?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Why-Inclusive-Learning?">Why Inclusive Learning?</a><a id="Why-Inclusive-Learning?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Why-Inclusive-Learning?" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Diversity in STEM starts with inclusive learning environments. Recall from the previous module that a prevailing reason students leave science majors is not because they are incapable, but because science is too often taught in a way that doesn’t inspire them or instill a sense of belonging. Consequently, more than half of the 600,000 US students who declare STEM majors change to a different major before graduating (Thiry et al., 2019), with students from underrepresented backgrounds switching out of STEM at disproportionate rates (Riegle-Crumb, et al, 2019).</p><p>Reversing STEM attrition requires us to reimagine how the various components of a classroom work together to create inclusive learning environments.</p><hr/><h2 id="A-Framework-for-Inclusive-Learning"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#A-Framework-for-Inclusive-Learning">A Framework for Inclusive Learning</a><a id="A-Framework-for-Inclusive-Learning-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#A-Framework-for-Inclusive-Learning" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>The Five Dimensions of Inclusive Teaching (Bell, et al. 2016) provides a framework for understanding how instructors, students, curriculum, and pedagogy collectively influence the classroom environment.</p><p>At the center of the framework is course climate, which encompasses the atmosphere and environment in which students learn. It is influenced by the other four dimensions: instructors (who we are), students (who we teach), curriculum (what we teach), and pedagogy (how we teach).</p><p><img src="../assets/five-dimensions-of-inclusive-teaching.svg" alt="Illustration of the five dimensions of inclusive teaching: Instructors, Pedagogy, Students, Curriculum, and Climate. Each dimension connects to the others, with Climate playing a central, moderating role."/></p><p>Figure adapted from (Bell et al., 2016;Marchesani and Adams, 1992).</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Activity: Reflection</h4><p>Which dimension(s) do you tend to think about most in your teaching? </p><p>Which dimension(s) may require more attention for you to consider?</p></div></div><hr/><h2 id="The-Climate-Dimension"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Climate-Dimension">The Climate Dimension</a><a id="The-Climate-Dimension-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Climate-Dimension" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Course climate is the manifestation of all the decisions that influence the learning environment. As instructors, our role is to examine how we set up and sustain learning experiences to be inclusive (Dewsbury &amp; Brame, 2019; Bell et al., 2016). An inclusive course climate is one where all students feel welcomed, valued, and supported in their learning, regardless of backgrounds and identities (Brame, 2019). </p><h3 id="The-Instructor-Dimension"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Instructor-Dimension">The Instructor Dimension</a><a id="The-Instructor-Dimension-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Instructor-Dimension" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Even though we are scientists, we are human and therefore not objective. As instructors, our identities are influenced by our values, principles, families, scientific disciplines, privileges, struggles, and all the factors that we experience during our lives (Rus et al., 2013; Peterson et al., 1999). Those influences also give us biases that lead to assumptions. </p><p>In aggregate, our identities, biases, and assumptions affect the pedagogical choices we make regarding the content and examples we highlight, as well as the values and skills we expect our students to learn. As a result, the instructor shapes the course climate and therefore each student&#39;s learning experience. </p><h3 id="The-Student-Dimension"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Student-Dimension">The Student Dimension</a><a id="The-Student-Dimension-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Student-Dimension" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Like instructors, students come to our courses with a composite of many identities and biases. Students interact with their instructors, with each other, and with  content in the context of a course’s climate. Students’ identities and their interactions influence the extent to which they feel a sense of belonging and the likelihood that they will learn the material and eventually persist in STEM. </p><h4 id="The-Connection-between-Identity-and-Belonging"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Connection-between-Identity-and-Belonging">The Connection between Identity and Belonging</a><a id="The-Connection-between-Identity-and-Belonging-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Connection-between-Identity-and-Belonging" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>The Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influence (TIMSI) explains the psychological mechanisms underlying belonging in STEM (Estrada et al., 2011). The TIMSI describes three orientations that contribute to student persistence in STEM:</p><ul><li><strong>Scientific self-efficacy:</strong> Students feel capable of performing the actions needed to be successful in science.</li><li><strong>Scientific identity:</strong> Students perceive science as part of who they are and feel a sense of belonging within a scientific community.</li><li><strong>Scientific values:</strong> Students authentically agree with the values of the scientific community, such as the importance of rigor and discourse in evaluating evidence.</li></ul><h3 id="The-Curriculum-Dimension"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Curriculum-Dimension">The Curriculum Dimension</a><a id="The-Curriculum-Dimension-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Curriculum-Dimension" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Curriculum is arguably the most visible component of a course and has an important influence on the course climate. Thus, we should carefully consider our decisions regarding which content is included or excluded. </p><h4 id="Science-Content"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Science-Content">Science Content</a><a id="Science-Content-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Science-Content" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Many studies demonstrate that active participation in science leads to an improved sense of belonging and retention in STEM (e.g., Estrada et al., 2011; Evans et al., 2021; Hanauer et al., 2017; Jordan et al., 2014; Lopatto et al., 2008; Olson et al., 2019; Shaffer et al., 2014; Waddell et al., 2021). This active participation requires that students engage with the six facets of science (described in the previous module). Our role as instructors is to establish which facets are most relevant for a specific course and work to bring them to life. The Scientific Teaching Course provides tools for this purpose in the following modules about course design and learning experiences.</p><h4 id="Diverse-Perspectives-and-Representations"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Diverse-Perspectives-and-Representations">Diverse Perspectives and Representations</a><a id="Diverse-Perspectives-and-Representations-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Diverse-Perspectives-and-Representations" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Part of scientific identity includes seeing one’s self and perspectives represented positively through the research questions asked, the outcomes discovered, and the individuals represented as scientists. Instructors decide whose voices are represented—which are all powerful ways to influence belonging in STEM. Strategies can be relatively simple, such as recognizing scientists from a variety of identities and backgrounds (Schinske et al., 2017), or complex, such as decolonizing the curriculum, which involves reimagining content and approaches that have historically prioritized Western, white, male-centric knowledge (Gichuru, 2024 ). </p><h3 id="The-Pedagogy-Dimension"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Pedagogy-Dimension">The Pedagogy Dimension</a><a id="The-Pedagogy-Dimension-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Pedagogy-Dimension" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Pedagogy involves how a course is designed and taught. It also defines how students interact with the content and each other. Once again, the choices we make determine how inclusive the course feels. In the Scientific Teaching module, we demonstrated how poor instruction leads to a pattern of exclusion from STEM that differentially affects students. In contrast, pedagogies that promote a sense of belonging lead to increased persistence in STEM (Estrada et al., 2011), especially for HEC students (Evans et al., 2021; Hurtado et al., 2009; Olson et al., 2019; Rodenbusch et al., 2016; Shuster et al., 2019; Waddell et al., 2021).</p><h3 id="Inclusive-Learning-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Inclusive-Learning-in-Practice">Inclusive Learning in Practice</a><a id="Inclusive-Learning-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Inclusive-Learning-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Let’s examine how the instructor, student, curriculum, and pedagogy dimensions work together to create a course climate that is based on inclusive learning. Below is a summary of several evidence-based practices based on the five dimensions of inclusive teaching.</p><h3 id="Choose-Evidence-based-Interventions"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Choose-Evidence-based-Interventions">Choose Evidence-based Interventions</a><a id="Choose-Evidence-based-Interventions-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Choose-Evidence-based-Interventions" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Interventions can be incorporated as individual or repeated activities, such as:</p><ul><li>Increase <strong>instructor immediacy and presence</strong> by making eye contact, engaging in positive body movements such as nods and smiles, communicating goals, setting guidelines for student interactions, and encouraging student participation (Shea et al., 2006; Baker, 2010; Andersen et al., 1981; Arbaugh &amp; Hwang, 2006).</li><li>Use <strong>active learning experiences</strong>, in which students actively engage with content and sometimes each other (Freeman et al., 2014). You’ll find many examples in the Learning Experiences module.</li><li>Do regular <strong>formative assessments</strong>, in which students have the opportunity to regularly practice and receive feedback (Black and Wiliam, 1998). More in Learning Experiences.</li><li>Encourage <strong>microaffirmations</strong>, which are statements that affirm a student’s capabilities (Estrada et al., 2019)</li><li>Leverage activities that <strong>increase resilience</strong> by reframing social adversity as common and transient (Walton and Cohen, 2011)</li><li>Incorporate interventions that make explicit the <strong>utility value</strong> of a course or its parts (Harackiewicz et al., 2016; Asher et al., 2023).</li><li>Take actions that mitigate <strong>stereotype threat</strong>, which occurs when individuals fear they may confirm negative stereotypes about their social group, which in turn can negatively impact their performance (Steele et al., 2002).</li></ul><p><img src="../assets/five-dimensions-of-inclusive-teaching-hori.svg" alt="Illustration of the five dimensions of inclusive teaching, with a focus on dimensions dealing with evidenced-based interventions: curriculum, climate, and pedagogy."/></p><p>Instructors can also modify overall course structure or infuse practices into an entire course to accomplish an inclusive learning environment. Some examples:</p><ul><li>Create a culture where <strong>failure is a productive and normal part of science</strong>, rather than a judgement on students&#39; identity (Petroski 2006; Simpson and Maltese, 2017; Lopatto et al., 2020; Gin, et al., 2018; Good et al., 2012; Koch et al., 2008; Cacciotti, 2015).</li><li>Use <strong>high-structure course design</strong> to elucidate what is expected of students and create predictable patterns (Freeman et al., 2011; Theobald et al., 2020). More on this in Course Structure.</li><li>Teach a <strong>course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE)</strong>, in which students engage in research while enrolled in a course (Aikens et al., 2017; Dolan and Weaver, 2021; Hurtado et al., 2009). More on this in Learning Experiences.</li><li>Leverage <strong>universal design for learning</strong> principles, which incorporate accessibility considerations into course design that provide equal access and opportunities for everyone, regardless of their abilities (Burgstahler &amp; Cory, 2008).</li></ul><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Activity: Taking Action for Inclusive Learning</h4><p>Describe 2-3 new actions you could take to promote inclusive learning in your course.</p></div></div><h3 id="Consider-Identities"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Consider-Identities">Consider Identities</a><a id="Consider-Identities-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Consider-Identities" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Identity comprises the social, emotional, and professional attributes of an individual (Rus et al., 2013; Peterson et al., 1999). It can be influenced by life experiences, positionality, and power. Identity affects how we choose to present ourselves, relate to others, and prioritize content, which in turn, influences the learning climate.  Social identity is defined as the sense of self that comes from membership in a social group and the value attached to membership within that group (Tajfel, 1981. p. 255). </p><p><img src="../assets/five-dimensions-of-inclusive-teaching-vert.svg" alt="Illustration of the five dimensions of inclusive teaching, with a focus on dimensions dealing with identities: instructors, climate, and students."/></p><p><strong>Social identity</strong> can change over time and between contexts (Gee, 2000). Moreover, we are each of us complex persons with multiple social identities that intersect, add up, and produce unique experiences–both for ourselves and how we are viewed by others (Crenshaw, 1989; Gordon, 1997). And while much social science in recent decades has worked toward identifying current and historical discrimination against members of protected social groups, it is important to also recognize the unique joys, places, desires, values, traditions, stories, practices, hardships, and acts of resistance that contribute to what it means to “belong” in one’s social groups (Tuck, 2009). </p><p><strong>Emotional identity</strong> characterizes how a person responds to their own emotions and the emotions of others. It is informed by experiences, power dynamics, and agency.</p><p><strong>Professional identity</strong> (in our case, teacher identity or STEM instructor identity) encompasses how individuals perceive themselves and construct their professional identities as teachers within educational settings (Yuan &amp; Liu, 2021, p. 2). An instructor’s professional identity is dynamic and influenced by experience and positionality (Sachs, 2005, p.15).</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Activity: Identify Matching</h4><p>Drag and drop the following attributes with the identity category:</p><p>SOCIAL: race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, ability, veteran status, neurodiversity</p><p>EMOTIONAL: trauma history, mental health status, current state of mind, support network, overall health and well being</p><p>PROFESSIONAL: educational background, first-generation status, work experience, work-related interests, skills and abilities, positionality within an institution</p></div></div><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Activity: Reflect on Your Identity in Teaching Science</h4><p>Your identity matters.

Biases and assumptions matter, too. For example, biases and assumptions affect how we rate people, which can have consequences for hiring decisions and advancement.</p><p>Let’s examine hiring studies as one example of bias affecting outcomes. In one study (Moss-Racusin et al., 2012) 127 biology, chemistry, and physics faculty at six top US research universities received a student resume for a lab manager position. Each resume was randomly assigned a gendered name: “Jennifer” (female) or “John” (male). Otherwise, the applications were identical, and each evaluator saw only one version. Faculty then evaluated the student’s competence and hireability and proposed a salary.</p><p>What results would you predict? Click here to find out what happened!</p><!-- `TODO add figs` --><p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Science faculty rated male applicants higher than women regarding competence and hireability for a lab manager position (p &lt; 0.001). Scales range from 1 to 7, with 7 being the highest score.</p><!-- `TODO add figs` --><p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Science faculty provided higher salary offers for male applicants than women for a lab manager position (p &lt; 0.01).  Interestingly, the gender of the reviewer did not affect scores or salaries. Both men and women faculty scored women students lower and offered lower salaries. Compounded over a 40-year career, a 4,000 disparity in a starting salary—or being 25% less likely to be hired—has serious economic repercussions for women. </p><p>Dozens of studies have compared hiring decisions with the same setup, all yielding the same result: Evaluators are substantially more likely to hire and pay a higher salary if an applicant has a man’s name. <strong>These results have not changed for 50 years.</strong></p><p>In fact, we hold biases about everything imaginable—not just hiring. For a more complete list of the HEC groups affected by bias and assumptions in STEM higher education, check out the supplementary materials for Achieving STEM Diversity: Fix the Classrooms (Handelsman et al., 2022). </p><p>Bias is not inherently bad and is part of human nature. But when bias leads to recurring, systemic inequalities that cause negative socioeconomic impacts and structural inequities, we need to pay attention and effect change. </p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Activity: Reflect on Bias and Assumptions</h4><p>What biases have you seen or experienced in STEM higher education?</p></div></div><hr/><h2 id="Summary-of-Inclusive-Learning"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Summary-of-Inclusive-Learning">Summary of Inclusive Learning</a><a id="Summary-of-Inclusive-Learning-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Summary-of-Inclusive-Learning" title="Permalink"></a></h2><ul><li>The instructor, students, curriculum, and pedagogy influence each other and collectively affect the course climate.</li><li>Instructors can leverage these dimensions to create inclusive learning environments.</li><li>Inclusive learning environments lead to persistence and diversity in STEM.</li></ul><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Activity: Takeaways from Inclusive Learning</h4><p>Identify two key takeaways that resonate most with you after completing this module.</p></div></div></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../intro/">« Scientific Teaching</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../learning/">How Learning Works »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">© 2024 The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.8.0 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Wednesday 11 December 2024 19:39">Wednesday 11 December 2024</span>.
