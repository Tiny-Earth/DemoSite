For example, a meta-analysis of 200 published papers comparing student outcomes in matched courses found that students in active courses consistently performed half a standard deviation higher than those in passive classes (Freeman et al., 2014). Likewise, a survey of nearly 1,000 students who experienced active learning more often reported higher learning gains and improvements in collaborative skills. (Reilly and Reeves, 2024). Another study found that polling questions that challenged students to think critically and solve problems collaboratively led to improved learning gains—and more questions correlated with higher gains (Smith et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2011).","category":"page"},{"location":"experiences/","page":"Active Learning Experiences","title":"Active Learning Experiences","text":"Failure rates also illuminate a stark contrast between courses taught with an active vs. traditional (passive) approach.

They make decisions based on the case description and their prior knowledge, thinking beyond the context of the case and consider the broader impacts of their decisions.\nConcept mapping: Starting with a central idea or concept, students generate related ideas, words, and phrases. They use arrows with short descriptions to connect concepts and create a visual web of relationships, then explain it to each other or the instructor.\nDecision making: Students take on the role as policy-makers and are presented with a scenario or problem. They must gather information, think critically about their options, and develop a creative solution.\nDiscussion forums: Students participate in an online discussion forum/board on their learning management platform. Students take turns posing questions and responding to posts.\nPolling: Students respond to questions or polls using a “clicker” or their personal devices. Results are displayed in real-time, which allows students to see their peers’ answers, discuss, or reflect.\nExit tickets: Students submit something before leaving class, such as work from an in-class activity like drawings, concept maps, or written responses from a think-pair-share.\nGroup problem solving: In pairs or small groups, students solve a problem or scenario. Each group then shares their findings with the class.\nJigsaw: Each group of students works on a particular topic (a “puzzle piece”) that is different from all the other groups. Each group member becomes an “expert” on their topic. Students are then re-distributed into new groups in which each expert shares their knowledge with other group members, completing a “jigsaw puzzle.”\nMuddiest Point: This version of an “exit ticket” that asks students to write one question they have or to list a point they still don’t understand.\nOne-minute writes: With one minute to respond, students reflect, think critically, or brainstorm in response to a question or prompt. These can be collected as “exit tickets.”\nProblem-based learning: Students address a complex and real-life question that has a specific goal. They work in teams to assess the problem, research more information, and devise a solution.\nQuizzes: Students complete short, frequent assessments that can gauge prior knowledge, preparedness for class, or understanding of the week’s lessons.\nEquitable call: Students are randomly selected to participate in activities, answer questions, or share their thoughts. This can be done in various ways: create a roster that lists students’ names in a random order, pick names from a bucket, distribute tokens such as playing cards and randomly draw cards. Note: Pairing this with a think-pair-share can make this activity more equitable and just.\nSelf-reflection/journaling: Students keep a journal of their learning to reflect on their progress, noting what they’ve understood and what they need to improve.\nStrip sequence: Students receive the steps (written, pictorially, or both) to a process on strips of paper that are jumbled.

The report purported that addressing these weaknesses required improving undergraduate STEM education based on evidence. The report recommended widespread adoption of active learning strategies and undergraduate research experiences.\nIndicators for Monitoring Undergraduate STEM Education, a National Academies report, reinforced goals for improving the quality and impact of undergraduate STEM education (Dibner et al., 2018) by engaging students in evidence-based educational practices. They broadened the call for reformed STEM education to include equitable access to opportunities, in addition to using inclusive practices.\nLevers for Change (the Advancement of Science and others, 2019) noted that the benefits of active learning extended beyond knowledge and skills to include “attitudes, sense of belonging, and persistence in STEM” and again pleaded for widespread adoption of evidence-based strategies to support students.\nThe Federal Strategic Plan for Advancing STEM Education and Cultivating Talent (Marsh and Hattie, 2002) proposed organizing a plan for coordinating federal agencies across several areas: STEM engagement, teaching and learning, workforce development, research and innovation, and environments. The report called out course-based research experiences as an effective tool for providing students with access and opportunity to STEM research.\nIn Equitable and Effective Teaching in Undergraduate STEM Education: A framework for institutions, educators and disciplines, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM 2025) stated that the lack of widespread adoption of evidence-based teaching perpetuates educational disparities.

Each neuron connects to many other neurons, creating a vast and unique network of 100 trillion neural connections within each brain (Kuan et al., 2020). Reinforcing specific connections between neurons leads to long-lasting synaptic pathways that determine neurotransmitter release, receptor number and binding properties (Bassett and Sporns, 2017).

When students reflect on their learning, they learn to plan strategies, monitor their progress, and evaluate their success at achieving a goal (Shraw and Moshman 1995). When students use metacognitive regulatory practices, such as checking their answers or explaining to themselves why they answered something incorrectly, they often improve both understanding and performance (McDonnell and Mullally, 2016; Kalyuga 2010).

As described above, students bring prior knowledge to everything they do; thus, it is critical to discover whether this knowledge is moving them forward, or preventing them from constructing new knowledge.\nHow students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know. Both this principle and the next highlight that students move from novice to more expert by learning how to organize their knowledge, connect principles, and engage in lots of practice!\nExpertise requires skills, practice, and application.\nMotivation determines, directs, and sustains what students do to learn. We have not explicitly discussed motivation yet, but few would argue the importance of motivation in learning. We are all motivated by different factors; helping students uncover what most motivates them is critical.\nGoal-directed practice and targeted feedback enhances the quality of learning. Related to principles 2 and 3 above, this principle highlights the intersection of goals and motivations with practice, feedback and reflection: all required for a robust learning experience.\nStudents’ level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate to impact learning. Learning does not occur in a vacuum. It is a social endeavor, impacted by one’s environment. As the designers of curricula, we must be sensitive and responsive to students’ whole experience as learners.\nTo become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning. This principle ties back to one of the frameworks for learning, metacognition. Metacognition is at the core of self-regulated learning, in which students are aware of their knowledge, able to seek new resources or study strategies when necessary, and ultimately evaluate the depth of their own knowledge.","category":"page"},{"location":"learning/#Learning-in-Practice","page":"How Learning Works","title":"Learning in Practice","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"learning/","page":"How Learning Works","title":"How Learning Works","text":"Tapping into these frameworks requires a shift from thinking about students as having deficits toward thinking about the learning environment as having deficits (Griffin et al., 2010).

For instance, communicate that you believe all students can be successful as you share constructive feedback (Killpack and Melon, 2016).\nBuild your self-awareness of what you bring to the classroom in terms of your identities, educational experiences, and biases, and consider how this impacts your interactions with students (Dewsbury, 2020).   \nUse strategies to mitigate biases such as grading anonymously, using rubrics, and structuring participation to hear from a range of students rather than those who readily share ideas (Killpack and Melon, 2016; Tanner 2013).

We ask and answer scientific questions with relevance to their lives, and I highlight the work of diverse scientists whenever possible. We connect the science to historical legacies of exclusion and privilege in science. Everything for class is on our learning management system, which ensures students can find materials even if they miss class. I have built a lot of structure in my course such as pre-class readings with quizzes and post-class reflection assignments to help students monitor and progress their learning. I use frequent low-stakes assessments with timely feedback, and I make sure to tell them it's ok to make mistakes.

Data collected from departments on the campus undergoing transformation are especially powerful: it’s hard to argue against the fact that students on one’s own campus (not some theoretical students in the literature) are learning less than they might be if they were taught differently. Finally, enthusiasm and positive examples propel any movement forward. It is hard to dismiss a colleague who is armed with good values about learning goals, data about student outcomes, excitement, and examples of success.","category":"page"},{"location":"transformation/#Campus-Policies","page":"Institutional Transformation","title":"Campus Policies","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"transformation/","page":"Institutional Transformation","title":"Institutional Transformation","text":"A pervasive myth at research universities is that teaching doesn’t matter, thereby steeping faculty in a culture that places teaching in conflict with research. Consequently, policies, when reinforced by dedicated administrators, can transform campus values and practice. Policies can elevate the importance of teaching as a whole and make clear that the administration values the integration of teaching and research—rather than viewing teaching and research as separate, competing endeavors. For example, allocating 1/3 of merit pay increases to instructional practices sends a message that teaching matters and that it will be rewarded. Tenure guidelines can include strong language to indicate that teaching accomplishments are necessary for tenure and should include a clear description of what teaching criteria will be evaluated. Sabbaticals can be awarded based on proposals to improve teaching or to integrate teaching and research, rather than on research-only plans. Some administrators offer additional new-faculty start-up funds that are designated for teaching. These funds can be used to attend teaching workshops, purchase equipment for student-friendly classrooms, or host educators from other universities to present seminars on teaching.

Many are dismayed to find that their colleagues look askance at the new teaching methods and are dismissive in conversations about teaching. Changing faculty behavior is never easy. It can feel Sisyphean—endlessly repetitive, unrewarded, and defeating. But a few strategies have been found more effective than simply telling colleagues about new techniques, which is bound to fail. One of the most effective is team teaching. When colleagues see active learning in action, they can’t deny its power. Students will aid the case because once they become used to active engagement, they will complain about instructors who force them back into the passive mode. Another way to engage colleagues, letting the methods speak for themselves, is to invite peer review. Most colleagues are flattered by being asked to review another’s teaching and everyone benefits: the instructor being reviewed will often gain useful insights, the reviewer will see active learning in action, and the two instructors will begin a dialogue about teaching. Finally, department chairs can invite their faculty to read a book or article about teaching, such as Leaving the Lectern (McManus, 2005) and discuss it at a faculty meeting or faculty retreat.","category":"page"},{"location":"transformation/#Campus-Teaching-Events","page":"Institutional Transformation","title":"Campus Teaching Events","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"transformation/","page":"Institutional Transformation","title":"Institutional Transformation","text":"Well-constructed teaching seminars and courses can be transformative.

In addition to seminars for faculty, courses for graduate students and postdocs who will be the next generation of faculty are essential ingredients in the recipe for change.

Published in 1995 by Dr. Jo Handelsman and colleagues, the course also included a revolutionary companion guide for teaching assistants that described how to use active and cooperative learning approaches with the evidence to back up why. In the early 2000s, these materials grew to serve a broader audience outside the course and drew from the scholarship of teaching and learning, discipline-based education research, action research, evidence-based instructional practices, teaching-as-research, and others. The content, however, was unique in its focus on scientific disciplines and higher education. As content expanded and became codified, it became a set of hole-punched pages gathered in a three-ring binder. Later versions of fancy binders had pre-printed tabs to denote section breaks, but many of the early tabs were hand-written.","category":"page"},{"location":"post/","page":"Postscript","title":"Postscript","text":"Regardless of format, each binder contained a fresh, new perspective on STEM teaching and learning because it leveraged the best educational approaches known at the time. It included a synthesis of the current state of recommended STEM education practices with content pulled from higher education, K-12 literature, and curriculum and instruction research, along with practical examples and tools for teaching. The scientific teaching binders served as the textbook for graduate student courses taught through the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Wisconsin Program for Scientific Teaching, and subsequently, starting in 2004, for the National Academies Summer Institute on Undergraduate Education in Biology. Held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for many years, both programs modeled scientific teaching through their interactive formats, active learning approaches, and cooperative group projects. Each iteration of these programs informed an evolution of the scientific teaching body of knowledge. For example, backward design approaches, educational taxonomies, facilitator training content, and institutional transformation tips were added as a direct result of what we and our colleagues learned each time we led one of these programs.","category":"page"},{"location":"post/","page":"Postscript","title":"Postscript","text":"In 2004, Dr. Handelsman and colleagues published an article in Science magazine, which both coined the “scientific teaching” term and served as a call to arms to reform how science was taught in higher education.

Freeman and Co. in 2007, where it could be bundled and freely distributed with STEM textbooks to reach more instructors. The published book swiftly became the foundation for two decades of graduate programs and national, regional, and local institutes held around the world. The book and its programs were cited as exemplary approaches to college STEM education reform in reports such as Vision and Change (AAAS 2009) and Engage to Excel (PCAST, 2012).

Low-structure courses assume that students know how to effectively learn and practice with course materials on their own outside of class. However, many students have not developed effective study strategies or time management skills (Hartwig and Dunlosky, 2012). High-structure courses scaffold student learning with increased engagement and practice both in and outside of class. Therefore, they decode the learning process through clear and accessible learning goals and expectations which can be especially helpful for students from HECs (Eddy and Hogan, 2014; Beck and Roosa, 2020).

Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.\nYou make our class what it is. Our class will be awesome because of the diversity of perspectives, thoughts, and experiences that we will share through our work. Who you are, what you bring to our class, your perspective–it's important.Then, complete one of the following activities to create language you can use in your syllabus or other \"welcome to the course\" materials:Write 1-2 sentences to welcome students by conveying that the students matter, they have a right to learn this material, and that they belong in this course and in STEM.\nExplain how the course is relevant to its students.\nExplain how your students will engage with the facets of science.\nDescribe how your students may communicate with you.\nDescribe your expectations for how your students will work together on collaborative assignments and discussions.\nHighlight a few ways that the course is accessible and how your students can find resources, including resources you provide and the university itself provides. (Tip: Universities in the US are required to publish a yearly Security and Fire Safety Report, which usually list university resources. These can be helpful places to start finding resources if your university does not already advertise them all in one place.)","category":"page"},{"location":"structure/#Summary-of-Course-Structure","page":"Course Structure","title":"Summary of Course Structure","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"structure/","page":"Course Structure","title":"Course Structure","text":"Inclusive course structure involves a course map and a learner-centered syllabus.\nA course map provides a template for enacting backward design principles.\nA learner-centered syllabus welcomes students to the course and to science by decoding how learning works in your course.\nHigh-structure course design involves organizing a course with clearly defined expectations and a well-defined schedule.
