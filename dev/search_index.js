Practicing antiracism requires constantly identifying, challenging, and replacing existing racist acts and policies to foster equity between racial groups.\nApproach\nCourse design\nEquity: The condition in which individuals are provided the resources they need to have access to the same opportunities as the general population. Equity accounts for systematic inequalities, meaning the distribution of resources provides more for those who need them most.\nDimensions of teaching and learning\nDiversity: The myriad of ways in which people differ, including the psychological, physical, cognitive, and social differences that occur among all individuals, such as race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, religion, education, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, mental and physical ability, immigration status, and learning preferences. Diversity is all-inclusive and supportive of the proposition that everyone and every group should be valued.\nFacets of science\nFormative assessment\nGraded review assignments: Tasks or assessments that evaluate students' understanding, comprehension, and recall of previously covered material. Examples: case studies, writing assignments, discussion posts, quizzes, projects.\nHistorically excluded community (HEC)\nHistorically included community  (HIC)\nInclusion: Authentically bringing traditionally excluded individuals or groups into processes, activities, and decision- and policy-making in a manner that shares power.\nInclusive learning\nInstructor/ Educator\nJustice: A concept of fair and just relations between the individual and society. It involves ensuring that power, wealth, education, healthcare, and other opportunities are distributed fairly among individuals regardless of their background. It also means treating people of all races fairly, so that everyone has the same chances and outcomes. Achieving racial justice requires putting systems and measures in place that actively work towards equal treatment and opportunities for people of all races.\nLearning\nLearning environment\nLearning experience\nLearning goal\nLearning objective\nLearning outcome\nMetacognition\nNature of science\nPhilosophy\nPractice\nPreparatory assignments: Tasks or activities given to students prior to a class or lesson to help them prepare for upcoming content. Examples: reading assigned texts, watching videos, researching a topic, completing practice exercises.\nPrinciple\nPrior knowledge\nRubric\nScientific teaching\nSchema\nStudent/ Learner\nSummative assessment\nTechnique\nTool\nUtilty Value Intervention: A task designed to help students recognize the practical significance and usefulness of the content they are learning, linking it to their own goals, interests, and future aspirations.","category":"page"},{"location":"Old/structure/","page":"Glossary","title":"Glossary","text":"If you live somewhere in which you cannot use certain AJEDI language in your course or syllabus, considering using these alternative terms:","category":"page"},{"location":"Old/structure/","page":"Glossary","title":"Glossary","text":"Access/ Accessibility\nBelonging\nCelebration of differences\nCollaboration\nEmpathy\nLearning community\nOpen-mindedness\nRespect\nSupport\nUnderstanding\nWelcoming enivronment","category":"page"},{"location":"Old/structure/","page":"Glossary","title":"Glossary","text":"(Lawrence and Keleher, 2004; Miller et al., 2022)","category":"page"},{"location":"contributing/#Contributing","page":"Contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"contributing/#Code-of-Conduct","page":"Contributing","title":"Code of Conduct","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"contributing/","page":"Contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Code of Conduct.

Likewise, a survey of nearly 1,000 students who experienced active learning more often reported higher learning gains and improvements in collaborative skills. (Reeves et al., 2024).

Students take turns posing questions and responding to posts.\nElectronic audience response systems: Students respond to questions or polls using a “clicker” or their personal devices. Results are displayed in real-time, which allows students to see their peers’ answers, discuss, or reflect.\nExit tickets: Students submit something before leaving class, such as work from an in-class activity like drawings, concept maps, or written responses from a think-pair-share.\nGroup problem solving: In pairs or small groups, students solve a problem or scenario. Each group then shares their findings with the class.\nJigsaw: Each group of students works on a particular topic (a “puzzle piece”) that is different from all the other groups.

This section presents strategies for instructors and administrators to effect changes—small and large—at the local and global levels. A few themes pervade these recommendations. First, data are essential to institutional transformation. Evidence-based arguments are received better by scientists and are easier to defend than opinions, so it is critical to use both review articles and original research studies that document the value of scientific teaching (Handelsman et al., 2004). Data collected from departments on the campus undergoing transformation are especially powerful: it’s hard to argue against the fact that students on one’s own campus (not some theoretical students in the literature) are learning less than they might be if they were taught differently. Finally, enthusiasm and positive examples propel any movement forward.

Consequently, policies, when reinforced by dedicated administrators, can transform campus values and practice. Policies can elevate the importance of teaching as a whole and make clear that the administration values the integration of teaching and research—rather than viewing teaching and research as separate, competing endeavors. For example, allocating 1/3 of merit pay increases to instructional practices sends a message that teaching matters and that it will be rewarded. Tenure guidelines can include strong language to indicate that teaching accomplishments are necessary for tenure and should include a clear description of what teaching criteria will be evaluated. Sabbaticals can be awarded based on proposals to improve teaching or to integrate teaching and research, rather than on research-only plans. Some administrators offer additional new-faculty start-up funds that are designated for teaching.

It can feel Sisyphean—endlessly repetitive, unrewarded, and defeating. But a few strategies have been found more effective than simply telling colleagues about new techniques, which is bound to fail. One of the most effective is team teaching. When colleagues see active learning in action, they can’t deny its power. Students will aid the case because once they become used to active engagement, they will complain about instructors who force them back into the passive mode. Another way to engage colleagues, letting the methods speak for themselves, is to invite peer review. Most colleagues are flattered by being asked to review another’s teaching and everyone benefits: the instructor being reviewed will often gain useful insights, the reviewer will see active learning in action, and the two instructors will begin a dialogue about teaching. Finally, department chairs can invite their faculty to read a book or article about teaching, such as Leaving the Lectern (McManus, 2005) and discuss it at a faculty meeting or faculty retreat.","category":"page"},{"location":"transformation/#Campus-Teaching-Events","page":"Institutional Transformation","title":"Campus Teaching Events","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"transformation/","page":"Institutional Transformation","title":"Institutional Transformation","text":"Well-constructed teaching seminars and courses can be transformative.

Published in 1995 by Dr. Jo Handelsman and colleagues, the course also included a revolutionary companion guide for teaching assistants that described how to use active and cooperative learning approaches with the evidence to back up why. In the early 2000s, these materials grew to serve a broader audience outside the course and drew from the scholarship of teaching and learning, discipline-based education research, action research, evidence-based instructional practices, teaching-as-research, and others. The content, however, was unique in its focus on scientific disciplines and higher education. As content expanded and became codified, it became a set of hole-punched pages gathered in a three-ring binder.

The scientific teaching binders served as the textbook for graduate student courses taught through the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Wisconsin Program for Scientific Teaching, and subsequently, starting in 2004, for the National Academies Summer Institute on Undergraduate Education in Biology. Held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for many years, both programs modeled scientific teaching through their interactive formats, active learning approaches, and cooperative group projects. Each iteration of these programs informed an evolution of the scientific teaching body of knowledge.

Freeman and Co. in 2007, where it could be bundled and freely distributed with STEM textbooks to reach more instructors. The published book swiftly became the foundation for two decades of graduate programs and national, regional, and local institutes held around the world. The book and its programs were cited as exemplary approaches to college STEM education reform in reports such as Vision and Change (AAAS 2009) and Engage to Excel (PCAST, 2012).

Provide a question or prompt and give students one-minute to write their response. These can be collected as “exit tickets.”\nJigsaw: Divide students into small groups and assign each group a topic or text. Each group member becomes an “expert” on a specific part of the topic. Students are then re-distributed into groups in which each expert shares their knowledge with other group members.\nGroup problem solving: Assign a problem or scenario, and have students work in pairs or small groups.

They must gather information, think critically about their options, and develop a creative solution.\nConcept mapping: Start with a central idea or concept and have students generate related ideas, words, and phrases. Use arrows with short descriptions to connect concepts, creating a visual web of relationships.\nCase-based learning: Present an open-ended, real-world situation that requires critical thinking and problem-solving. Students make a decision based on the case description and their prior knowledge. Ask students to think beyond the context of the case and consider the broader impacts of their decisions.\nProblem-based learning: Present a complex and real-life question that has a specific goal. Students work in teams to assess the problem, research more information, and devise a solution.\nExit tickets: A catch-all term for students turning in something before leaving class. These can include:\nCompleting a brief questionnaire about what they learned and found most confusing.\nSubmitting work from an in-class activity such as drawings, concept maps, or short writings.\nSelf-reflection/ Journaling: Students keep a journal of their learning, reflecting on what they’ve learned and what they need to work on.\nDiscussion forums: Students participate in an online discussion forum/ board on the class learning management platform.

However, many students have not developed effective study strategies or time management skills (Hartwig and Dunlosky, 2012). High-structure courses scaffold student learning with increased engagement and practice. Therefore, they decode the learning process through clear and accessible learning goals and expectations which can be especially helpful for students from HECs (Eddy and Hogan, 2014; Beck and Roosa, 2020).

Please email me or speak to me if you have concerns or issues related to access.If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am available to meet with you during office hours or by appointment to discuss any course-related topics or questions you may have. My door is also always open if you need guidance or someone to speak to about non-course topics.I look forward to meeting you and working with you throughout the semester.

It invites us to be aware of how our social, emotional, and pedagogical perspectives shape how we teach. Take Professor González, for example, who shares a story about themself on the first day of class: [vignette] \"I was born in Puerto Rico but grew up outside Sacramento, California, with my family and two black cats. I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I was able to take advantage of multiple research programs nearby at Sac State and in San Francisco during my college summers. I hated the first program in anthropology. All I did was dig in the dirt looking for ancient shards of broken pottery, alone in the hot sun. I never knew why my effort mattered, and I was ready to leave science. But the project between my sophomore and junior years convinced me to stay: My supervisor partnered with an Antarctic research group to analyze data from ice core extractions. We had weekly video calls with the team on site to discuss our findings. I loved the global and team aspects of the research. After that experience, my courses made more sense and were more relevant, so I found myself applying myself harder to school because I felt like I had purpose and direction. I was admitted to grad school followed by a 2-year postdoc. Now I am a climate scientist trying to predict how human activity affects the planet’s heating and cooling cycles. I still have two black cats (but they are different cats).\" The story above is simple, but it contains multitudes. It requires the instructor to consciously reflect on the identities they bring into the classroom, and to consider what may interest or inspire students. This particular story elicits elements of wayfinding through multiple experiences outside a normal college curriculum, which could inspire students to do the same. It also talks about working with a global team, inferring that the instructor is open-minded and curious. The story hints that the professor is Puerto Rican or other Latine origin and couples it with a successful outcome of becoming a college professor, demonstrating a positive example of someone from an HEC succeeding in STEM. By injecting light humor about pets, the instructor conveys humanity and approachability, which cue a safe and supportive learning environment. We can all tell a story on the first day of class. If you do nothing else, do that. But what else can we do?
