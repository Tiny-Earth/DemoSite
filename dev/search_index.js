By giving students a sense of autonomy and ownership over their learning, active learning can increase student motivation and enthusiasm, leading to improved learning outcomes.\nWhen students are actively involved in the learning process, they are more likely to retain and transfer the knowledge they gain to new contexts. This is because active learning helps students connect new information to their existing knowledge and experiences, making it more meaningful and memorable.\nActive learning helps close the achievement gap for students who have been historically excluded from science.

A 2020 UN report showed that only 21.7% of African STEM students graduate, compared with 24.3% in Europe and Central Asia, and 25.6% in the USA. Africa's education training programs suffer from inequalities and exclusion at all levels: education expenditures, inadequate teacher development programs, limited access to electricity and internet, and inadequate infrastructure for STEM teaching and learning. The challenges will be not only to improve science curriculum through evidence-based practices, but also to secure the basic resources needed to support instructors and colleges.","category":"page"},{"location":"intro/","page":"Scientific Teaching","title":"Scientific Teaching","text":"In a recent (2022-23) report on Diversity and Inclusion in STEM, the UK government identified several structural inequities, calling for raising levels of diversity and inclusion in STEM education, while also mentioning the importance of measuring change.","category":"page"},{"location":"intro/#STEM-has-an-Equity-Problem-in-US-Higher-Education","page":"Scientific Teaching","title":"STEM has an Equity Problem in US Higher Education","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"intro/","page":"Scientific Teaching","title":"Scientific Teaching","text":"Underrepresentation in STEM is primarily due to attrition in the US.

Too often, both instructors and students stop at the level of remembering a fact or understanding a concept at a basic level. Testing provides better feedback to a student than the more passive strategies of re-reading or re-watching. To make the most of practice, students also need to reflect on their learning and figure out what they do and don’t know–i.e. Regulate.

We connect the science to historical legacies of exclusion and privilege in science. Everything for class is on our learning management system, which ensures students can find materials even if they miss class. I have built a lot of structure in my course such as pre-class readings/quizzes and post-class reflection assignments to help students monitor and progress their learning. I use frequent low-stakes assessments with timely feedback, and I make sure to tell them it's ok to make mistakes while they are learning-that's what class is for.

I mostly stick to the textbook but have added in a few diverse examples of engineers who are women and persons of color. I have a syllabus with some flexibility in due dates, and I let them drop their lowest exam score. In class, I stop and ask if people have questions, but they almost never do. Lab is interactive and students work in pairs. It's worth 30% of their grade, so when they make mistakes and their designs fail, it can adversely affect their final grades.
