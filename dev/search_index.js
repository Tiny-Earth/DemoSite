They must gather information, think critically about their options, and develop a creative solution.\nConcept mapping: Start with a central idea or concept and have students generate related ideas, words, and phrases. Use arrows with short descriptions to connect concepts, creating a visual web of relationships.\nCase-based learning: Present an open-ended, real-world situation that requires critical thinking and problem-solving. Students make a decision based on the case description and their prior knowledge. Ask students to think beyond the context of the case and consider the broader impacts of their decisions.\nProblem-based learning: Present a complex and real-life question that has a specific goal. Students work in teams to assess the problem, research more information, and devise a solution.\nExit tickets: A catch-all term for students turning in something before leaving class. These can include:\nCompleting a brief questionnaire about what they learned and found most confusing.\nSubmitting work from an in-class activity such as drawings, concept maps, or short writings.\nSelf-reflection/ Journaling: Students keep a journal of their learning, reflecting on what they’ve learned and what they need to work on.\nDiscussion forums: Students participate in an online discussion forum/ board on the class learning management platform. Students take turns posing questions and responding to posts.\nQuizzes: Students complete short, frequent assessments that can gauge prior knowledge, preparedness for class, or understanding of the week’s lessons.","category":"page"},{"location":"experiences/","page":"Learning Experiences","title":"Learning Experiences","text":"note: \nDesigning Learning ExperiencesExamine the active learning techniques listed in the section above.

The learning objectives are transparent, and we do a variety of student-centered activities in class that help them practice skills related to the objectives. We ask and answer scientific questions with relevance to their lives, and I highlight the work of diverse scientists whenever possible. We connect the science to historical legacies of exclusion and privilege in science. Everything for class is on our learning management system, which ensures students can find materials even if they miss class. I have built a lot of structure in my course such as pre-class readings/quizzes and post-class reflection assignments to help students monitor and progress their learning. I use frequent low-stakes assessments with timely feedback, and I make sure to tell them it's ok to make mistakes while they are learning-that's what class is for. I encourage students to ask questions and to work together to generate their own understanding. I really love talking with my students.

Not only do 18% of them fail each semester, the majority of those who fail are students of color, women, or first-generation students. This really bothered me, so I've been trying to make some changes, but I don't know how to specifically help those students. I mostly stick to the textbook but have added in a few diverse examples of engineers who are women and persons of color. I have a syllabus with some flexibility in due dates, and I let them drop their lowest exam score. In class, I stop and ask if people have questions, but they almost never do. Lab is interactive and students work in pairs. It's worth 30% of their grade, so when they make mistakes and their designs fail, it can adversely affect their final grades.

This guideline aims to promote understanding and reduce barriers to learning by selecting language and symbols that are familiar and meaningful to all learners. This can be achieved by providing captioning, transcripts, and audio descriptions for multimedia content, incorporating pictures or symbols to represent concepts, and avoiding jargon or complex language whenever possible, and providing alternative means of representation for students with different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.\nComprehension: Incorporate a variety of instructional techniques to ensure that students can access, process, and assimilate new information and knowledge. Instructors need to provide supports and scaffold curriculum to help students comprehend the material.

Low structure courses assume that students know how to efficiently work with course materials in and outside of class. However, data suggest that many students do not implement effective study strategies nor time management skills (Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012).

Published in 1995 by Dr. Jo Handelsman and colleagues, the course also included a revolutionary companion guide for teaching assistants that described how to use active and cooperative learning approaches with the evidence to back up why.\n\nIn the early 2000s, these materials grew to serve a broader audience outside the course and drew from the scholarship of teaching and learning, discipline-based education research, action research, evidence-based instructional practices, teaching-as-research, and others. The content was, however, unique in its focus on scientific disciplines and higher education. As content was added, it became a set of hole-punched pages gathered in a three-ring binder and many hand-written tabs.\n\nEach binder contained a fresh, new perspective on STEM teaching and learning because it leveraged the best educational approaches known at the time. It included a synthesis of the current state of recommended STEM education practices with content pulled from higher education, K-12 literature, and curriculum and instruction research, along with practical examples and tools for teaching. The scientific teaching binders served as the textbook for graduate student courses taught through the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Wisconsin Program for Scientific Teaching, and eventually, starting in 2004, for the National Academies Summer Institute on Undergraduate Education in Biology.\n\nHeld at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for many years, both programs modeled scientific teaching through their interactive formats, active learning approaches, and cooperative group projects. Each iteration of these programs informed an evolution of the scientific teaching body of knowledge. For example, backward design approaches, educational taxonomies, facilitator training content, and institutional transformation tips were added as a direct result of what we and our colleagues learned each time we led one of these programs.\n\nIn 2004, Dr. Handelsman and colleagues published the first eponymous article about scientific teaching in *Science* magazine, which both coined the term and served as a call to arms to reform how science was taught in higher education [handelsman_scientific_2004](@cite). Soon after, in the winter of 2006, Scientific Teaching was first printed as a book by Roberts & Co., and moved to W.H. Freeman and Co. in 2007, where it could be bundled and freely distributed with STEM textbooks to reach more instructors [handelsman_scientific_2007](@cite).\n\nThe published book swiftly became the foundation for two decades of graduate programs and national, regional, and local institutes held around the world. The book and its programs were cited as exemplary approaches to college STEM education reform in reports such as *Vision and Change* and *Engage to Excel*, eventually growing to a five-volume series. Over XX,000 copies have been printed and distributed, and we estimate more than XX,000 instructors use the content or its derivatives. \n\nWhile *Scientific Teaching* was revolutionary at its first printing and many of its tenets and recommended practices have stood the test of time, nearly two decades have passed.\n\nNew interventions and research findings have blossomed in many fields – education research, social science, education psychology, inclusive learning, online and hybrid learning, discipline-based education research, and more – rendering many of the perspectives, practices, and philosophies from the first edition Scientific Teaching incomplete or outdated.\n\nTherefore, we assembled a diverse team of instructors with the expertise and experience to do again what scientific teaching does best: synthesize the current state of knowledge while providing practical guidance, examples, and tools. However, this version is (obviously) not a book. Instead, it draws on new learning principles, is framed as an interactive, and is a self-guided course that models scientific teaching practices. \n\nOur goal is that the digital *Scientific Teaching Course* can position you and your colleagues to enact relevant and necessary STEM education improvements through the mid-21st century. We hope that your courses taught using these principles inspire a generation of college students – especially those from groups historically excluded from STEM – to see themselves as scientists and be equipped to address the scientific challenges that lie ahead. \n\n-->","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Scientific Teaching Course","title":"Scientific Teaching Course","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"#Structure-of-the-Course","page":"Scientific Teaching Course","title":"Structure of the Course","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Scientific Teaching Course","title":"Scientific Teaching Course","text":"The course is modular and designed to be self-paced.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Scientific Teaching Course","title":"Scientific Teaching Course","text":"Part One provides an overview of scientific teaching and a call to action.\nPart Two builds on that foundation, providing opportunities to engage with the content, practice with the tools, self-assess, reflect, and apply to your own teaching.\nPart Three provides tools to synthesize what you learned and identify areas for further development.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Scientific Teaching Course","title":"Scientific Teaching Course","text":"<!-- \n- A companion workbook is provided `TODO in Google drive` that you can download and use for tracking reflections and designing your course materials as you progress through the course.\n-->","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Scientific Teaching Course","title":"Scientific Teaching Course","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"#FAQ","page":"Scientific Teaching Course","title":"FAQ","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Where-do-I-begin?","page":"Scientific Teaching Course","title":"Where do I begin?","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Scientific Teaching Course","title":"Scientific Teaching Course","text":"Before you begin, we recommend you select one of your STEM courses to revise or build anew as you proceed through the modules.
