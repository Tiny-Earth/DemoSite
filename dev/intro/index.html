TODO From Becca:

I'm not quite convinced of the framing of opportunity gaps (see Shukla et al 2022,
https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.21-05-0130). It's still framing comparisons
around a white male control group...

Diversity of the future workforce should match the demographics of the world’s citizens, take advantage of underutilized talent in all demographic groups, and make STEM careers readily available to people of all backgrounds.</p><p>Yet inequities continue to plague college science education, denying opportunities to students who identify as members of underrepresented racial or ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQIA+, or first-generation in college.

TODO from Cara:

This slide feels K-12y to me. Is that what this is based on? If the purpose of the slide is to establish
"we have a problem" I wonder if it would be more valuable to cite research for why students are leaving
STEM in college - building on the previous slide - because it might feel more relevant to our audience
and more immediately actionable.

shifting it in this way would also better align with this key concept from earlier slide: Poor teaching
methods are the main reason college students switch out of STEM majors.

Whether they major in biology, art history, math, or elementary education, no one should not complete a college education without understanding basic principles and facts about the world around them. Equally important, our students need to emerge with an understanding of the facets of science so they can appreciate the origins of scientific information, think critically about new problems and situations, and sustain a lifelong curiosity about the world around them. The need to solve global problems and navigate the difference between evidence-based claims and opinions is becoming increasingly important.</p><p><em>Scientific teaching is needed because diversity is important to science.</em></p><p>Teaching science in a way that reflects how science is done can broaden participation in STEM. When students actively engage in authentic scientific practices, they develop a more robust scientific self-efficacy and identity (<a href="../refs/#estrada_toward_2011">Estrada <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>). When students witness diverse scientist identities and engage in real-world problems, it allows a broader range of students to connect with and envision themselves as part of the scientific community. These factors – positive self-efficacy, identity, and connection with scientific values – lead to increased persistence in STEM, especially for students from communities that have been historically excluded (<a href="../refs/#estrada_toward_2011">Estrada <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>). Broadening participation in STEM is essential for asking meaningful questions, addressing inequities, and ensuring that STEM benefits everyone.</p><h3 id="The-Facets-of-Science"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Facets-of-Science">The Facets of Science</a><a id="The-Facets-of-Science-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Facets-of-Science" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p><img src="../assets/six-facets-of-science.svg" alt="Illustration of the six facets of science: Science Practices, Iteration, Discovery, Authenticity, Ownership, and Relevance"/></p><p>In order to achieve these goals, we need to teach in a way that intentionally engages students with the six facets of science:</p><ul><li><strong>Science Practices:</strong> Ask questions, carry out investigations, analyze and communicate data</li><li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Identify and resolve problems in multiple cycles</li><li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Engage in research tasks that have unknown outcomes</li><li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Engage in innovation and collaboration to address original research questions</li><li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Develop a sense of responsibility for and personal connection to  research findings</li><li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Apply the outcomes and applications of scientific discoveries to real world-contexts</li></ul><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Identifying the Facets of Science</h4><!-- TODO where is the full citation used below? --><p>The facets of science listed on the previous slide can be categorized into three categories (Brownell &amp; Kloser, 2015):</p><ul><li>Thinking and feeling like a scientist</li><li>Communicating like a scientist</li><li>Using the tools of a scientist</li></ul><p>Which facets of science belong in each category?</p></div></div><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Embodying the Facets of Science</h4><p>Compare the following two course schedules with the facets of science in mind.</p><p>Then rate the extent to which each addresses each of the facets of science:</p><ul><li>How well does it embody <strong>Science Practices</strong>, high, medium, or low?</li><li>How well does it embody <strong>Iteration</strong>, high, medium, or low?</li><li>How well does it embody <strong>Discovery</strong>, high, medium, or low?</li><li>How well does it embody <strong>Authenticity</strong>, high, medium, or low?</li><li>How well does it embody <strong>Ownership</strong>, high, medium, or low?</li><li>How well does it embody <strong>Relevance</strong>, high, medium, or low?</li></ul><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click here to show the Course 1 Schedule</summary><div class="admonition-body"><p><strong>Week 1:</strong></p><ul><li>Before class, complete a reading and a quiz.</li><li>In class we will discuss: What are the facets of science?</li><li>And in Lab: Orientation to the lab, research, and discovery by diverse scientists; and importance of lab safety and sterile technique.</li></ul><p><strong>Week 2:</strong></p><ul><li>Before class, complete a reading and a quiz.</li><li>In class we will discuss: Evolution.</li><li>And in lab: Ask 3 research questions about antibiotic discovery.

Good teaching also means approaching your teaching with the same rigor and spirit of your scientific research.</p><p><em>This involves being intentional, inclusive, and iterative.</em></p><p>Scientific teaching aims to bring a philosophy and framework to teaching that makes the process more rigorous, reflective, and evaluative. Drawing from discovery and evidence-based strategies, scientific teaching provides a model for teaching that parallels science research. Rather than allowing a last-minute, somewhat random approach to designing classes, scientific teaching emphasizes intentional planning and using empirical evidence and data to inform instructional decisions. This not only allows the instruction to evolve over time, it also means students are engaging in the best possible STEM learning experience, which can also be very rewarding for instructors.</p><p>Like science, these teaching principles take time to practice and implement.
