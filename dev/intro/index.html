Diversity of the future workforce should match the demographics of the world’s citizens, take advantage of underutilized talent in all demographic groups, and make STEM careers readily available to people of all backgrounds.</p><p>Yet inequities continue to plague college science education, denying opportunities to students who identify as members of underrepresented racial or ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQIA+, or first-generation in college. Collectively, we refer to these and other underrepresented groups as historically excluded communities (HECs).</p><p>To achieve an equitable educational enterprise, we must address the structural, individual, intentional, and unintentional biases that discourage HEC students from pursuing STEM.</p><p><code>TODO what are the full citation used in the below sentence?</code></p><p>Opportunity gaps between overrepresented and underrepresented students have been called “one of the most urgent and intractable problems in higher education” (Theobald et al., 2022, Bensimon 2005).</p><h3 id="What-the-US-Reports-Say-about-STEM-Education"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What-the-US-Reports-Say-about-STEM-Education">What the US Reports Say about STEM Education</a><a id="What-the-US-Reports-Say-about-STEM-Education-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What-the-US-Reports-Say-about-STEM-Education" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Most US science is taught as lectures that are dominated by facts rather than principles and ways of thinking (Stains et al.). Sadly, substantial evidence shows that lecturing alone is a relatively ineffective way of teaching, and retention from lectures is poor. But report after report shows there are better ways to teach science, to teach scientifically, and that these approaches also serve to make science education more equitable:</p><p><code>TODO what are the full citations used in the points below?</code></p><ul><li>In <em>Science for All</em>, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1989) called for a scientifically literate public and charged higher educators with teaching scientific habits of mind.

International reports echo the American reports:</p><p><code>TODO what are the full citations used in the paragraphs below?</code></p><p>In <strong>India</strong>, the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER 2022) found serious structural inequities with respect to college STEM. Only 18% of schools had a functional computer lab. More than 9% STEM instructor positions were vacant, reaching 25% in some regions. Outdated teaching methods, lack of computing infrastructure, and resource deficits worsen the situation, especially in rural areas. The report recommends a focus on resources to support quality STEM education around critical thinking, multidisciplinary learning, and strong foundations in scientific discovery. It aims to prepare over 250 million young Indians across socioeconomic backgrounds for 21st century jobs and equip them to solve complex real-world problems through technology.</p><p><strong>Africa</strong> perhaps has the most opportunity to grow regarding STEM education. A 2020 UN report showed that only 21.7% of African STEM students graduate, compared with 24.3% in Europe and Central Asia, and 25.6% in the USA. Africa&#39;s education training programs suffer from inequalities and exclusion at all levels: education expenditures, inadequate teacher development programs, limited access to electricity and internet, and inadequate infrastructure for STEM teaching and learning. The challenges will be not only to improve science curriculum through evidence-based practices, but also to secure the basic resources needed to support instructors and colleges.</p><p>In a recent (2022-23) report on Diversity and Inclusion in STEM, the <strong>UK</strong> government identified several structural inequities, calling for raising levels of diversity and inclusion in STEM education, while also mentioning the importance of measuring change.</p><h3 id="STEM-has-an-Equity-Problem-in-US-Higher-Education"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#STEM-has-an-Equity-Problem-in-US-Higher-Education">STEM has an Equity Problem in US Higher Education</a><a id="STEM-has-an-Equity-Problem-in-US-Higher-Education-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#STEM-has-an-Equity-Problem-in-US-Higher-Education" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Underrepresentation in STEM is primarily due to attrition in the US.

Whether they major in biology, art history, math, or elementary education, no one should not complete a college education without understanding basic principles and facts about the world around them. Equally important, our students need to emerge with an understanding of the facets of science so they can appreciate the origins of scientific information, think critically about new problems and situations, and sustain a lifelong curiosity about the world around them. The need to solve global problems and navigate the difference between evidence-based claims and opinions is becoming increasingly important.</p><p><strong>Scientific teaching is needed because diversity is important to science:</strong></p><p>Teaching science in a way that reflects how science is done can broaden participation in STEM. When students actively engage in authentic scientific practices, they develop a more robust scientific self-efficacy and identity (<a href="../refs/#estrada_toward_2011">Estrada <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>). When students from witness diverse scientist identities and engage in real-world problems, it allows a broader range of students to connect with and envision themselves as part of the scientific community. These factors – positive self-efficacy, identity, and connection with scientific values – lead to increased persistence in STEM, especially for students from communities that have been historically excluded (<a href="../refs/#estrada_toward_2011">Estrada <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>).

It also considers how students integrate scientific knowledge with authentic practices that represent the facets of science and acknowledge their diverse identities, beliefs, and experiences.</p><p>This shift doesn’t mean students don’t learn facts; it means they learn to organize their thinking while learning them.</p><h3 id="Growth-mindset-opportunity!"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Growth-mindset-opportunity!">Growth mindset opportunity!</a><a id="Growth-mindset-opportunity!-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Growth-mindset-opportunity!" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Reframe how you think of the course material and the role of instructors and students in the course:</p><ul><li>Instead of: Instructor covers the science facts</li><li>Move toward: Students learn the facets of science</li></ul><h3 id="Good-teaching-is-intentional,-inclusive,-and-iterative"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Good-teaching-is-intentional,-inclusive,-and-iterative">Good teaching is intentional, inclusive, and iterative</a><a id="Good-teaching-is-intentional,-inclusive,-and-iterative-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Good-teaching-is-intentional,-inclusive,-and-iterative" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Good teaching creates learning experiences for students to engage in the practices of science – more on that in the next two modules. Good teaching also means approaching your teaching with the same rigor and spirit of your scientific research.</p><p><strong>This involves being intentional, inclusive, and iterative.</strong></p><p>Scientific teaching aims to bring a philosophy and framework to teaching that makes the process more rigorous, reflective, and evaluative. Drawing from discovery and evidence-based strategies, scientific teaching provides a model for teaching that parallels science research. Rather than allowing a last-minute, somewhat random approach to designing classes, scientific teaching emphasizes intentional planning and using empirical evidence and data to inform instructional decisions. This not only allows the instruction to evolve over time, it also means students are engaging in the best possible STEM learning experience, which can also be very rewarding for instructors.</p><p>Like science, these teaching principles take time to practice and implement. Also like science, we advocate that you select from practices that demonstrate positive student outcomes and carefully evaluate which approaches will work in your context.</p><div class="admonition is-warning"><header class="admonition-header">Workbook</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Complete Activity TK in your workbook:</p><p>Which reasons for incorporating the practices of science into your course are most motivating for you personally?
