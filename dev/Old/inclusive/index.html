Recall the five dimensions to inclusive teaching:

- **Instructor--Who we are:** Be aware of how our social, emotional, and pedagogical perspectives shape how we teach.
- **Students--Who we teach:** Plan meaningful interactions when we are aware of the many dimensions of our students.
- **Curriculum--What we teach:** Choose diverse content, perspectives and contexts with students’ needs and backgrounds in mind.  
- **Pedagogy--How we teach:** Impact learning by implementing evidence-based teaching practices and creating engaging activities with aligned assessments. 
- **Climate--How the class is designed:** Create an environment that enriches student learning through supportive structure and peer connections.

--><p><code>Text from Sarah: XX et al proposed a framework to illustrate the variables that affect course climate, called the Five Dimensions of Inclusive Teaching. The five dimensions are:</code> <code>Instructor–Who we are: Be aware of how our social, emotional, and pedagogical perspectives shape how we teach. Students–Who we teach: Plan meaningful interactions when we are aware of the many dimensions of our students.

It invites us to be aware of how our social, emotional, and pedagogical perspectives shape how we teach. Take Professor González, for example, who shares a story about themself on the first day of class:</code> <code>[vignette] &quot;I was born in Puerto Rico but grew up outside Sacramento, California, with my family and two black cats. I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I was able to take advantage of multiple research programs nearby at Sac State and in San Francisco during my college summers. I hated the first program in anthropology. All I did was dig in the dirt looking for ancient shards of broken pottery, alone in the hot sun. I never knew why my effort mattered, and I was ready to leave science. But the project between my sophomore and junior years convinced me to stay: My supervisor partnered with an Antarctic research group to analyze data from ice core extractions. We had weekly video calls with the team on site to discuss our findings. I loved the global and team aspects of the research. After that experience, my courses made more sense and were more relevant, so I found myself applying myself harder to school because I felt like I had purpose and direction. I was admitted to grad school followed by a 2-year postdoc. Now I am a climate scientist trying to predict how human activity affects the planet’s heating and cooling cycles. I still have two black cats (but they are different cats).&quot;</code> <code>The story above is simple, but it contains multitudes. It requires the instructor to consciously reflect on the identities they bring into the classroom, and to consider what may interest or inspire students. This particular story elicits elements of wayfinding through multiple experiences outside a normal college curriculum, which could inspire students to do the same. It also talks about working with a global team, inferring that the instructor is open-minded and curious. The story hints that the professor is Puerto Rican or other Latine origin and couples it with a successful outcome of becoming a college professor, demonstrating a positive example of someone from an HEC succeeding in STEM. By injecting light humor about pets, the instructor conveys humanity and approachability, which cue a safe and supportive learning environment.</code> <code>We can all tell a story on the first day of class. If you do nothing else, do that. But what else can we do? (1) Reflect on and share your identities (2) Address your biases and assumptions, (3) Gauge your own sense of belonging</code></p><!--
### Share Your Identity

 `TODO wheres the data?` --><p><strong>Social identity</strong> is defined as the sense of self that comes from membership in a social group (or groups) along with the &quot;value and emotional significance attached to that membership&quot; (Tajfel, 1981. p. 255). For example, identifying as queer also means identifying with current and historical discrimination against members of the queer community.</p><p>Social identity is not always fixed and can change over time and between contexts (Gee, 2000).</p><p>Additionally, individuals usually have multiple social identities that intersect with each other, producing unique experiences in which some identities privilege the individual and some identities oppress them.</p><p>Similarly, <strong>teacher identity</strong> is defined as &quot;the ways teachers make sense of themselves and the images they present to others&quot; (Yuan &amp; Liu, 2021, p. 2). It encompasses how instructors perceive themselves and how they construct their professional identities within educational settings.</p><p>Like social identity, instructor identity is dynamic and &quot;negotiated through experience and the sense that is made of that experience&quot; (Sachs, 2005, p.15).</p><p>Social identities and instructor&#39;s professional identities (Rus et al., 2013; Peterson et al., 1999) can include:</p><figure>

Once again, the choices we make determine how inclusive the course feels. Some evidence-based practices that foster inclusion are: (1) Leverage active learning and formative assessment (LE), (2) Provide transparency in expectations and create predictable patterns (CD, SA), and (3) Incorporate universal design and accessibility principles (CD, CS)</code></p><p>By adopting the principles of Universal Design, an instructor can build an inclusive course from the outset.</p><p><strong>Universal Design for Learning (UDL)</strong> is a <em>framework for designing and delivering flexible, inclusive, and accessible learning experiences that can be customized to meet the needs of all learners</em>, regardless of their abilities, backgrounds, or learning preferences (CAST, 2018). It is rooted in the principles of <strong>Universal Design</strong>, which is an approach to creating products, environments, and experiences that are <strong>usable by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation or specialized design</strong>. UDL is based on the idea that learning should be engaging, relevant, and responsive to individual needs. Importantly, <strong>UDL aims to change the design of the environment rather than to change the learner.</strong></p><p><strong>Universal Design for Learning (UDL)</strong> <em>places accessibility at the forefront and leverages various AJEDI principles</em> for improving teaching and learning for all students. To help implement UDL in the classroom, the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) developed the <strong>UDL Guidelines</strong> (CAST, 2018). These are <em>a set of principles and strategies that aim to provide equal and inclusive access to learning for all students</em>, including those with disabilities or diverse learning styles. The guidelines provide specific recommendations for creating flexible and engaging learning environments and materials that can be customized to meet the diverse needs and preferences of all students.</p><p>The UDL Guidelines encompass <strong>three key principles:</strong> providing multiple means of (1) Engagement, (2) Representation, and (3) Action and Expression.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs10.jpeg" alt/></p><h3 id="UDL-Guidelines:-Multiple-Means-of-Representation"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#UDL-Guidelines:-Multiple-Means-of-Representation">UDL Guidelines: Multiple Means of Representation</a><a id="UDL-Guidelines:-Multiple-Means-of-Representation-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#UDL-Guidelines:-Multiple-Means-of-Representation" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>In this module, we will be focusing on the principle of providing <strong>multiple means of Representation.</strong> This principle outlines strategies for creating course materials that provide options for perception, language and symbols, and comprehension.</p><ul><li><strong>Perception:</strong> <em>Present information in a variety of formats</em>, such as visual, auditory, and tactile. Instructors can use this principle to ensure that textbooks, videos, lectures, and other course materials are accessible to all students, including those with disabilities or those who process information differently. By incorporating visual aids, videos, diagrams, and other interactive media, instructors provide multiple ways of representing important information and allow students to choose the means that work best for them.</li><li><strong>Language &amp; Symbols:</strong> <em>Use clear, concise, and accessible language and symbols and avoid language or symbols that may be exclusive, biased, or offensive.</em> This guideline aims to promote understanding and reduce barriers to learning by selecting language and symbols that are familiar and meaningful to all learners. This can be achieved by providing captioning, transcripts, and audio descriptions for multimedia content, incorporating pictures or symbols to represent concepts, and avoiding jargon or complex language whenever possible, and providing alternative means of representation for students with different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.</li><li><strong>Comprehension:</strong> <em>Incorporate a variety of instructional techniques to ensure that students can access, process, and assimilate new information and knowledge.</em> Instructors need to provide supports and scaffold curriculum to help students comprehend the material. This can include activating or providing prior knowledge; providing explicit cues or prompts to emphasize key elements, concepts, and features; embedding scaffolds and feedback to organize and process information; and incorporating opportunities for students to apply their knowledge to new contexts.</li></ul><p>For more information on the other two principles, visit the <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/">CAST UDL website</a>.</p><h3 id="Structuring-for-Accessibility"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Structuring-for-Accessibility">Structuring for Accessibility</a><a id="Structuring-for-Accessibility-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Structuring-for-Accessibility" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Providing access to resources is <strong>fundamental to addressing inequities</strong>, because it ensures that course structures, artifacts, and the environment do not preclude anyone from learning. However, <em>the mere existence of a resource</em> <strong>does not by itself lead to equitable and inclusive outcomes.</strong></p><p><strong>Accessibility</strong> refers to the <em>design and creation of products, devices, environments, and content that can be used and accessed by all people</em>, including those with disabilities or other impairments. The goal of accessibility is to <strong>provide equal access and opportunities for everyone, regardless of their abilities</strong>, so that they can participate fully in all aspects of society. This includes considerations such as physical, digital, and social accessibility.</p><p>In the context of education, accessibility refers to the practice of creating learning environments, resources, and technologies that allow all students to access and engage with academic content and participate in learning activities.</p><ul><li><strong>Physical accessibility:</strong> Make physical spaces and materials accessible, such as by providing wheelchair ramps, captioning videos, and offering alternative formats of textbooks. </li><li><strong>Digital accessibility:</strong> Design digital content and technologies that are compatible with assistive technologies, such as screen readers and text-to-speech software.</li><li><strong>Social accessibility:</strong> Use inclusive language, accommodate different communication styles.</li></ul><h3 id="The-Need-for-Accessibility"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Need-for-Accessibility">The Need for Accessibility</a><a id="The-Need-for-Accessibility-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Need-for-Accessibility" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Students with disabilities face many challenges when seeking accommodations in higher education (Gin et al., 2020).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs24.png" alt/></p><p>An accessible course design <strong>reduces the need for accommodation, alleviates the burden and stigma</strong> associated with students seeking accommodations, <strong>saves time</strong> for educators, and <strong>diminishes the cost</strong> associated with providing individual accommodations. Importantly, accessibility <strong>improves educational outcomes for all learners</strong> by making sure that educational materials and resources are available and usable by everyone, regardless of their individual needs.</p><p>Universal Design for Learning (UDL) provides a framework that guides educators to create accessible course materials and flexible and inclusive learning experiences that meet the needs of all learners, regardless of their abilities or background. Why build a course with UDL at the forefront instead of accommodating student needs as they arise? Consider this passage from Rose and colleagues (2006):</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Such an environmental view fosters solutions that <strong>address the limitations of the learning environment</strong> rather than the limitations of the student, while making the student less of a problem, and <strong>more a part of diversity within the course</strong>. The advantage of such universal solutions is that, as with such approaches in built environments, they are likely to be useful for many individuals; <strong>built once, applied many times.</strong>&quot; (p. 150)</p></blockquote><p><em>Individuals with disabilities are highly underrepresented in STEM degree attainment and STEM employment.</em></p><p>Individuals with disabilities enter postsecondary education at a slightly higher percentage in which they are represented in the general population.

--><p>Before the semester even starts, a student may feel intimidated or start doubting their ability to succeed. All students have the right to an education and should be given the tools and space to engage and learn. What can we do as educators to help all students succeed?</p><p>One of the first steps we can take is to be intentional in the ways we set up our course. In particular, we can influence the course climate–the overall learning environment in a classroom or educational setting–to be more inclusive (Dewsbury &amp; Brame, 2019). An inclusive course climate is one where all students feel welcome, valued, and supported regardless of different backgrounds and identities (Brame. 2019).</p><h3 id="Hot-or-Cold-or-Just-Right?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Hot-or-Cold-or-Just-Right?">Hot or Cold or Just Right?</a><a id="Hot-or-Cold-or-Just-Right?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Hot-or-Cold-or-Just-Right?" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Because course climate is a somewhat abstract concept, we will use an analogy to help us understand it more deeply: temperature.</p><p>A common phrase associated with group spaces is &quot;taking the temperature of a room,&quot; which means assessing and gauging the emotional or social atmosphere of a situation or group of people. It involves observing the general mood, attitudes, and reactions of individuals in a group to determine how they are feeling and what their overall response is to a situation or idea.</p><ul><li>🔥 <strong>Hot:</strong> The atmosphere is charged, tense, or hostile. It could also indicate that the individuals in the room are passionate or enthusiastic about a particular topic or idea, which can make others feel anxious or apprehensive about engaging. Students may engage in dismissive, disruptive, or disrespectful behaviors. The classroom environment may be overtly hostile to students based on race, gender, socioeconomic or other status, ability, or other demographic factors.</li><li>🧊 <strong>Cold:</strong> The atmosphere is unfavorable, unfriendly, or unwelcoming. The individuals in the room may be unresponsive or uninterested in the topic or discussion being presented. Students may withdraw from participating in activities or attending class altogether. The classroom environment may be covertly hostile to students based on race, gender, socioeconomic or other status, ability, or other demographic factors.</li><li>⚖️ <strong>Just Right:</strong> The atmosphere is collaborative, collegial, and supportive. It suggests that the individuals in the room are receptive and engaged, and conversations are respectful and inquiry-based. Diverse perspectives are encouraged and considered. This type of room temperature correlates with a respectful buzz of engagement, where everyone feels their voice is heard, their insights are valid, and their questions are welcome.</li></ul><!-- `TODO where's the data on how well (or not well) we can accurately gauge these things in a real setting? across cultures? etc.?` --><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Reflect on Course Temperatures</h4><p>Recall times when your courses – when you were a student – felt &quot;Hot,&quot; &quot;Cold,&quot; or &quot;Just Right.&quot; Try to describe a few examples of each.</p><p>Then reflect:</p><ul><li>What all do you think contributed to making those courses feel that way?</li><li>How did it impact your learning experiences in that course?</li><li>Did any course have a mix of &quot;Hot,&quot; &quot;Cold,&quot; or &quot;Just Right&quot; days?</li><li>Did any course feel at times &quot;Just Right&quot; to you, but &quot;Hot&quot; or &quot;Cold&quot; to your peers?</li></ul></div></div><h3 id="Impacts-of-Course-and-Campus-Climate"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Impacts-of-Course-and-Campus-Climate">Impacts of Course and Campus Climate</a><a id="Impacts-of-Course-and-Campus-Climate-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Impacts-of-Course-and-Campus-Climate" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The perception of being unwelcome in the college classroom was termed &quot;chilly climate&quot; by Hall and Sandler (1982) and then later expanded to include the campus environment (1984).

This can help students see that success is achievable regardless of their identity.</li><li><strong>Encourage collaborative learning:</strong> Promote group work and peer collaboration to create a sense of belonging and reduce the pressure on individual performance. Ensure groups are diverse and inclusive, so students can learn from and support each other.</li><li><strong>Affirm students’ values:</strong> Incorporate value-affirmation exercises, where students reflect on and write about their personal values and why they are important. This can buffer against stereotype threat by reinforcing students&#39; sense of self-worth.</li><li><strong>Offer constructive feedback:</strong> Give feedback that is specific, actionable, and focused on improvement. Be encouraging and let students know you believe in their potential to succeed.</li><li><strong>Promote self-reflection:</strong> Encourage students to reflect on their learning process and identify strategies that help them succeed.
