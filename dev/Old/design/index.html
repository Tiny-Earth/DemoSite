You modify it for your courses. You create presentations and you craft lectures. You prepare online course space so students can find the assignments they need. You prepare physical lab space so the flow of traffic does not impede hands-on learning. You plan, you adapt, you iterate.</p><p>And like in any type of design—from technology, to paintings, to skyscrapers, and yes, to science courses—you make decisions. Your decisions help you approach your aims, within your constraints. You’ll make decisions about your teaching before the semester begins, while teaching a unit, and after you’ve seen how it all played out. From designing new courses, to overhauling an old design you’ve inherited, and to continuously improving your teaching, as a science teacher you are as much a designer as you are a scientist.</p><p>In all three of these roles—teacher, scientist, designer—you hold a number of commitments that are relevant to, inspire, and inform how you carry out your course (<a href="../../refs/#flanagan2005values">Flanagan <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>; <a href="../../refs/#flanagan2014values">Flanagan and Nissenbaum, 2014</a>; <a href="../../refs/#belman2009instructional">Belman <em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>). As a teacher, you are likely committed to delivering on the specific learning objectives of your courses.

What should students know or be able to do after instruction? What are the desired results after the course or a lesson? Engaging in backward design intentionally integrates the curricula and pedagogy dimensions as we consider how to make our courses effective and inclusive for all students.</p><p>The process of backward design typically involves three stages:</p><ol><li>Establishing learning goals and objectives: What skills and knowledge should students learn?</li><li>Creating assessments that match those objectives: What evidence is needed to know if students have gained the skills and knowledge?</li><li>Designing learning experiences (instructional materials and activities) that will help students achieve those objectives: What activities will teach these skills and knowledge?</li></ol><p>Although backward design emphasizes starting with the end in mind, the process itself is not always strictly linear or sequential.</p><p>Educators may revisit stages of the backward design process multiple times to refine goals/objectives, assessments, and learning experiences. Additionally, backward design allows for flexibility in adjusting instructional strategies based on ongoing assessment of student needs and progress. This may result in revisions throughout the learning process, which may not adhere to a strictly &quot;backward&quot; order.</p><p>And importantly, this approach focuses on what students should be able to do as a result of their learning.</p><p>By prioritizing learning objectives, teachers are able to create more targeted and effective instruction that is better aligned with the needs of their students, rather than designing materials based on covering a certain amount of content.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Compare Two Courses</h4><p>Two professors are covering the same learning objective and using the same assessment in their introductory science courses.</p><ul><li>Objective: Using the scientific method, design an experiment based on a given hypothesis.</li><li>Assessment: Given the results of an experiment on antibiotic resistance, design a follow-up experiment that tests a revised hypothesis.</li></ul><p>They have both planned various activities to meet the learning objective:</p><figure>

Use concrete, observable terms that can be assessed through a variety of methods, such as tests, projects, or essays.</li><li><strong>Be realistic:</strong> The objective should be achievable within the context of the course unit and based on a reasonable level of prior knowledge or skill.</li><li><strong>Align with learning goals:</strong> The objective should align with a larger learning goal.</li></ul><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Align Goals and Objectives</h4><p>For each learning objective below, describe how it aligns with one or more specific learning goals further below:</p><p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p><ol><li>Predict how changes to the natural water cycle process from human activities affect other lifeforms on Earth.</li><li>Explain the connections between the various stages of the water cycle.</li><li>Evaluate the effects of droughts, floods, and water pollution on various civilizations around the globe.</li><li>Describe the water cycle and its different stages, including precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, surface runoff, and groundwater storages.</li><li>Analyze the human impact on the water cycle, including deforestation, urbanization, and climate change.</li></ol><p><strong>Goals:</strong></p><ol><li>Students will understand the water cycle as a complex process that involves the continuous movement and transformation of water through the environment.</li><li>Students will recognize the importance of the water cycle in sustaining life on earth and the implications of human activity on this process.</li><li>Students will develop critical thinking skills to analyze and evaluate the impact of changes in the water cycle on ecosystems and human societies.</li></ol></div></div><h3 id="Bloom&#39;s-Taxonomy"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Bloom&#39;s-Taxonomy">Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy</a><a id="Bloom&#39;s-Taxonomy-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Bloom&#39;s-Taxonomy" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy is a framework for categorizing educational goals, objectives and assessment by levels of cognitive complexity and specificity (Bloom, 1959).</p><p>Since its development, it has become a widely used tool for designing and assessing instruction. The taxonomy consists of six levels, where each level builds upon the prior (McNulty, 2019):</p><ol><li><strong>Remember:</strong> Can the learner recall or retain the information? Action verbs: define, duplicate, identify, list, memorize, name, recall, recognize, repeat, state</li><li><strong>Comprehend:</strong> Can the learner explain ideas or concepts? Action verbs: classify, describe, discuss, explain, locate, paraphrase, report, select, summarize, translate</li><li><strong>Apply:</strong> Can the learner use information in a new way? Action verbs: choose, demonstrate, dramatize, draw, employ, execute, illustrate, implement, interpret, operate, perform, sketch, solve, use</li><li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Can the learner distinguish between different parts? Action verbs: compare, contrast, deconstruct, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, infer, investigate, organize, predict, question, test</li><li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> Can the learner justify a stand or decision? Action verbs: appraise, argue, assess, criticize, critique, defend, judge, justify, prioritize, support, value</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> Can the learner create a new product or point of view? Action verbs: assemble, build, compose, construct, design, develop, devise, formulate, invent, plan, produce, write</li></ol><p>The framework is used to progressively move learners based on their prior knowledge and abilities from lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS) to higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS).</p><p>Action verbs appropriate for each level can be chosen to communicate the cognitive level of the objective or assessment.</p><p>There are many other ways to characterize cognitive levels; we recommend Bloom&#39;s taxonomy because it is straightforward and easy to use.</p><p>However, since it can be difficult to distinguish between the 6 levels of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy, we prefer to divide Bloom&#39;s by LOCS and HOCS.</p><p>In general, levels 1 and 2 are LOCS and levels 3-6 are HOCS. But depending on the context and what information the student is given, exercises written for higher Bloom&#39;s levels such as levels 3 (Apply) and 5 (Evaluate) can be considered LOCS. Often, the distinction depends on the novelty of the task. For example, if students do an evaluation activity in class (HOCS) and encounter the same exercise on an assessment, then it&#39;s no longer an evaluation, but a recall task (LOCS) that reinforces what was learned in class.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Practice Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy</h4><p>For each assessment prompt below, identify if targets a lower-order cognitive skill (LOCS) or higher-order cognitive skill (HOCS):</p><ol><li>Design an experiment to test one of Newton&#39;s laws of motion, including the necessary equipment, data collection methods, and analysis.</li><li>Use Figure 3 in the textbook to draw your own model that demonstrates one or more of Newton&#39;s laws of motion, including the necessary variables and assumptions.</li><li>Define Isaac Newton&#39;s three laws of motion, including examples of each.</li><li>Critique the validity of an experiment or study that uses Newton&#39;s laws of motion to explain a physical phenomenon, including its limitations and potential sources of error.</li><li>Explain the difference between mass and weight.</li><li>Considering the forces acting on an object in motion (direction and magnitude), predict the resultant motion of the object using Newton&#39;s laws.</li></ol></div></div><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Raising Learning Objective Bloom Levels</h4><p>Professor Kim realizes that many of the learning objectives for his botany course are at the Remember level of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy (Level 1).</p><p>To ensure that his students go beyond mere memorization and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, Professor Kim needs to articulate learning objectives for higher order skills.</p><p>One objective he needs to reword is:</p><blockquote><p>Label the parts of a plant cell and recall their functions, including the cell wall, nucleus, chloroplasts, and mitochondria.</p></blockquote><p>Help Professor Kim by rewriting this objective into two new learning objectives at two different Bloom&#39;s levels above Level 1.</p><p>You can use this list of action verbs to help reword the objective:</p><ol><li><strong>Remember:</strong> define, duplicate, identify, list, memorize, name, recall, recognize, repeat, state</li><li><strong>Comprehend:</strong> classify, describe, discuss, explain, locate, paraphrase, report, select, summarize, translate</li><li><strong>Apply:</strong> choose, demonstrate, dramatize, draw, employ, execute, illustrate, implement, interpret, operate, perform, sketch, solve, use</li><li><strong>Analyze:</strong> compare, contrast, deconstruct, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, infer, investigate, organize, predict, question, test</li><li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> appraise, argue, assess, criticize, critique, defend, judge, justify, prioritize, support, value</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> assemble, build, compose, construct, design, develop, devise, formulate, invent, plan, produce, write</li></ol></div></div><h3 id="Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments">Determine acceptable evidence and align objectives with assessments</a><a id="Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Once you have learning objectives that are aligned to learning goals, the next step is to design assessments that are aligned to the learning objectives.</p><p>Why is this such a critical step?

In this example, the learning objective, assessment, and activity are all at a lower-order cognitive level. If an instructor wishes to include assessments at a higher-order level, then additional activities must be designed to help progress students to that level.</p><p>Ideally, multiple activities are leveraged to help students get more practice, gain expertise toward higher-order skills, and engage a diversity of students in learning.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Align Objectives and Assessments: Part Two</h4><p>Professor Gupta has the following assessment question in their astronomy class:</p><blockquote><p>Astronomers have discovered a new star and have been collecting data on it such as its size, temperature, and luminosity.

    #### Plan Your Goals, Objectives, and Assessments

    ```@raw html
    <!-- `TODO see comment above, I think we need to draw out that they should think about all the complexity of how a goal can be demonstrated, what background students bring to it, etc.` ->
    ```

    *Answer in your workbook:*

    1. Reflect on and write your course goals. What is the purpose of this course? What big questions will it answer? What big problems will it aim to solve? What ways of thinking will it elucidate?
    2. Based on these course-level learning goals, think about how your course is broken up into units and identify the topics within each unit.
    3. Next, develop learning objectives that address each unit's topic. These are measurable and specific objectives that will inform you and your students on how well they learned the course content.
    4. Write out the learning objectives for each day of class. What will students learn? What will they be able to do? How do these objectives fit together within a unit?
    5. Plan your assessments. How will students demonstrate whether the objectives are achieved?
    6. Plan your activities. What activities will help students achieve the objectives? How will they practice their skills, learn knowledge, and gauge progress toward the learning objectives?

The <strong>conventional syllabus</strong> is <em>content-focused</em>, providing a brief overview of the course subject matter followed by a weekly outline of topics to be covered, and a list of assignments and course activities with relative grading weights and due dates.</p><p>A <strong>learner-centered syllabus</strong> also provides basic course information, but <strong>it shifts the emphasis</strong> from what the instructor will cover in the course <em>to what learning outcomes students will achieve by the end of the course</em> (Johnson, 2006). It explains how learning will be assessed and offers information and tools to promote student learning and intellectual development in an inclusive environment. It establishes the responsibilities of the instructor(s) and students for achieving course goals. In short, the learner-centered syllabus &quot;becomes an invitation to share responsibility for successful learning&quot; (O&#39;Brien et al., 2008, p. 22).</p><p>In his book, &quot;What the Best College Teachers Do,&quot; Ken Bain (2004) describes three parts of what he calls &quot;the promising syllabus&quot;:</p><ol><li><strong>Highlight the promises or opportunities.</strong><ul><li>What kinds of questions will the course help students answer?</li><li>What kind of intellectual, physical, emotional, or social abilities will it help them develop?</li><li>Why is the course relevant?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Explain what students will do to meet those promises.</strong><ul><li>What are the learning activities (e.g., activities, assignments, readings) that will be used in the course?</li><li>How will they learn from the course resources, the instructional team, and each other?</li><li>Give students a sense of agency in their education</li></ul></li><li><strong>Discuss how students will engage in the learning process.</strong><ul><li>How will the instructor and students best &quot;understand the nature and progress of their learning?&quot;</li><li>How will learning be evaluated?</li><li>How will all students feel included in the learning process and welcome as scientists?</li></ul></li></ol><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Learner-Centered Syllabus</h4><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click to see an example excerpt of a learner-centered syllabus</summary><div class="admonition-body"><p>The following is excerpted from Dr. Cara Gormally&#39;s asynchronous introductory biology class for non-majors (bilingual-American Sign Language &amp; English).</p><p><strong>What we&#39;ll actually do</strong></p><ul><li>You&#39;re likely taking this class because it&#39;s required for your major.</li><li>My goal: make this class actually useful to your life.</li><li>Together, we&#39;ll make this class meaningful for ourselves.

I&#39;m committed to anti-racism and I believe Black Lives Matter. Everyone belongs here in my classroom if you want to be here. In this class, we&#39;ll use materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, national origin, ethnicity, race, culture, etc. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.</li><li><strong>You make our class what it is.</strong> Our class will be awesome because of the diversity of perspectives, thoughts, and experiences that we will share through our work. Who you are, what you bring to our class, your perspective–it&#39;s important.</li></ul></div></details><p>Now that you&#39;ve seen a learner-centered syllabus, reflect on your own syllabus. (If you do not have one, think about a traditional syllabus or one from a course you&#39;ve taken.) Think about the elements in a learner-centered syllabus and the components of your syllabus.</p><p>What are two things you could change in your syllabus to make it more learner-centered? You can use these prompts to help you re-imagine your syllabus:</p><ul><li>What are the promises or opportunities presented by the instructor?</li><li>What activities will students do in order to meet those promises?</li><li>How will students track progress of their learning (i.e., how will learning be evaluated)?</li></ul></div></div><!--
