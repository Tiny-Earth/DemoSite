We often think of prior knowledge as “right” and “wrong.” We say that students either get it, or they don’t. This thinking leads us to assume that students hold misconceptions that need to be “corrected” or “replaced” with a right answer. We become frustrated when they get answers wrong that we lectured about or they read in the textbook.</p><p>However, prior knowledge is complex. Each student brings a set of knowledge, beliefs, experiences, and world views to every learning experience. In the 2010 book, How Learning Works: Seven research-based principles for smart teaching, Susan Ambrose et al., state: </p><ul><li>Students connect what they learn to what they already know, interpreting incoming information, and even sensory perception, through the lens of their existing knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions (Vygotsky, 1978; NRC 2000)…. students must connect new knowledge to previous knowledge in order to learn (Bransford &amp; Johnson, 1972; Resnick, 1983)…. However the extent to which students are able to draw on prior knowledge to effectively construct new knowledge depends on the nature of their prior knowledge, as well as the instructor’s ability to harness it. </li></ul><p><strong>Contending with Prior Knowledge</strong></p><p>&lt;u&gt;Activating prior knowledge:&lt;/u&gt;</p><p>Prior knowledge must be activated for learning to occur. Ambrose et al., again:</p><ul><li>When students connect what they are learning to accurate and relevant prior knowledge, they learn and retain more. In essence, new knowledge “sticks” better when it has prior knowledge to stick to.</li></ul><p>But students don’t always bring their knowledge or connect it to the learning experience at hand.</p><p>&lt;u&gt;Show me the evidence:&lt;/u&gt;</p><p>People with more knowledge of soccer recalled more scores from different soccer matches than people with less soccer knowledge (Morris et al., 1981). </p><p>When presented with new facts about individuals, college students were able to learn and retain those facts twice as often if the individuals were familiar when compared to unfamiliar individuals (Kole and Healy, 2007).</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p><strong>Round 1 [audio clip reads list, then do quiz below]</strong></p><p>Amir helped the children.

Understanding the types of prior knowledge can help us create better learning environments.</p><p>&lt;u&gt;Accurate but insufficient prior knowledge&lt;/u&gt;  </p><ul><li>Students possess some relevant knowledge, but it is not sufficient to support subsequent learning or a desired level of performance. The knowledge can be declarative (facts and concepts) or procedural (knowing when or how to apply procedures, methods, or theories). <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong></li></ul>Students know which statistical test to perform (declarative) but cannot apply it (procedural). Students may be able to apply formulas to data analysis (procedural) but not be able to explain their logic (declarative).</li></ul><p>&lt;u&gt;Inappropriate prior knowledge&lt;/u&gt; </p><ul><li>Students draw on prior knowledge that is not appropriate for the learning context. It is not necessarily inaccurate – it is merely used inaccurately.<ul><li><strong>Example:</strong></li></ul>Students’ everyday associations with the terms positive and negative skew their understanding of science concepts, such as negative controls in an experiment, or negative reinforcement in psychology.</li></ul><p>&lt;u&gt;Inaccurate prior knowledge&lt;/u&gt; </p><ul><li>Information that is objectively wrong. This includes incorrect facts, as well as flawed ideas, beliefs, models, or theories.<ul><li><strong>Example:</strong></li></ul>Students believe that Pluto is a planet or that the heart oxygenates the blood.</li></ul><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p><strong>Prior Knowledge and Misconceptions</strong></p><p>How can we con tend with all these types of prior knowledge? Be clear in the knowledge requirements for different tasks. Do not assume because students know the facts that they know how to apply them, and vice versa. Assess both the amount and nature of prior knowledge and design instruction accordingly. </p><p><em>Now you try!</em> Below is an example designed to elicit prior knowledge and misconceptions about antibiotic resistance and evolution. </p><p><strong>Student Activities:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Part 1.</p></blockquote><p>View A Tiny World video (3 min 11 sec). Identify three misconceptions stated by the interviewees and explain what is wrong with them.</p><blockquote><p>Part 2.</p></blockquote><p>Explain why each statement is incorrect. “I have a really bad cold.  I should go the doctor to get a prescription for antibiotics.” “Antibiotics are getting weaker.” “People are becoming immune to antibiotics.” “The bacteria mutated to become resistant to the antibiotic.”</p><p><strong>Engagement Prompts: Review the Student Activities.</strong></p><ul><li>How do these activities activate prior knowledge?</li><li>What type of prior knowledge would these activities detect?<ul><li>Accurate but insufficient - declarative</li><li>Accurate but insufficient - procedural</li><li>Inappropriate</li><li>Inaccurate</li></ul></li><li>How would you characterize the statements in Part 2?<ul><li>Accurate but insufficient - declarative</li><li>Accurate but insufficient - procedural</li><li>Inappropriate</li><li>Inaccurate</li></ul></li><li>What would you teach next in this course?</li></ul></div></div><p><strong>Research-Based Strategies for Contending with Prior Knowledge</strong></p><p>Gauge the extent and nature of students’ prior knowledge:</p><ul><li>Administer diagnostic assessments</li><li>Have students assess their own prior knowledge</li><li>Use brainstorming to reveal prior knowledge</li><li>Assign a concept map activity</li><li>Look for patterns of error in student work</li><li>Talk to a colleague</li></ul><p>Activate accurate prior knowledge: </p><ul><li>Use exercises to generate students’ prior knowledge (e.g., brainstorm, concept map)</li><li>Explicitly link new material to knowledge from previous courses or your course</li><li>Use analogies and examples that connect to everyday knowledge</li><li>Ask students to reason on the basis of relevant prior knowledge</li></ul><p>Address insufficient prior knowledge:</p><ul><li>Identify the prior knowledge you expect students to have</li><li>Remediate insufficient prerequisite knowledge</li></ul><p>Help students recognize inappropriate prior knowledge: </p><ul><li>Highlight conditions of applicability</li><li>Provide heuristics to help students avoid inappropriate application of knowledge </li><li>Explicitly identify discipline-specific conventions</li><li>Show where analogies break down</li></ul><p>Correct inaccurate knowledge:</p><ul><li>Ask students to make and test predictions</li><li>Ask students to justify their reasoning</li><li>Provide multiple opportunities for students to use accurate knowledge</li><li>Allow sufficient time</li></ul><p><strong>A Note about Misconceptions</strong></p><p>Misconceptions are a type of inaccurate prior knowledge that are especially resistant to correction. Misconceptions are models or theories that are deeply embedded in students’ thinking. For example, the notion that blind people have more sensitive hearing than sighted folks, and stereotypes about groups of people fall into this category. Misconceptions persist despite direct instructional interventions.</p><p>Misconceptions are difficult to refute for a number of reasons:</p><ul><li>They have been reinforced over time and across multiple contexts</li><li>Because they often include accurate–as well as inaccurate– elements, students may not recognize their flaws.</li><li>They allow for successful explanations and predictions in a number of everyday circumstances. For example, although stereotypes are dangerous simplifications, they are difficult to change in part because they fit aspects of our perceived reality and serve an adaptive human need to generalize and categorize (Allport 1952; Brewer 1988; Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991). </li></ul><p><strong>What to do?</strong> Guide students through a process of conceptual change over time, persistently creating opportunities to activate students’ awareness and motivation to apply reason over stereotypes. Creatively combine strategies from the STC. It takes time, patience, and creativity.</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Commit to one strategy to activate and address prior knowledge.

Learning requires adapting existing neural processes to orchestrate new pathways and new behaviors. Constructing knowledge involves making new neuronal connections and/or enhancing connections that exist.</p><p>At a cellular and molecular level, the changing nature, or plasticity, of neuronal connections can lead to long-lasting changes in synaptic connections, neurotransmitter release, receptor number and binding properties (Basett et al, 2017). The consequences of these changes for humans are new behaviors and an ability to use new knowledge. The formation of long-lasting connections, and the storage of this information are what we think of as memory. </p><p>Many things contribute to learning, including one’s prior experiences, stress, situational factors, and motivation. Each of these can create different conditions that either favor learning in general, or favor learning a particular aspect of a situation (for example, a familiar smell from childhood can bring back specific memories) (Gold and Korol, 2017). Significant learning experiences commonly involve an important event or relationship to real events, a level of interest or value in the experience, and an opportunity to apply and integrate new knowledge (Fink 2013).</p><hr/><h2 id="Factors-that-Affect-Learning"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Factors-that-Affect-Learning">Factors that Affect Learning</a><a id="Factors-that-Affect-Learning-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Factors-that-Affect-Learning" title="Permalink"></a></h2><div class="admonition is-compat"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><p><code>TODO: write these</code></p></div></div><p>Students are not necessarily well-informed about best learning practices. They often engage in whatever strategies have previously worked without being consciously aware of whether they are effective. Their choices are also affected by their interest in a topic, their motivation, and how much time they have to devote to learning something. </p><p><strong>Memory and Retrieval</strong></p><p>The strength of a memory represents how associated the memory is with related knowledge and skills. A brain region called the hippocampus is involved in creating and storing memories. How well you can retrieve a memory depends on how accessible that information is, which can be influenced by how recently you thought about the information as well as other situational cues. Sometimes easily retrieved information is also easily forgotten, because it has not been consolidated and stored (Bjork and Bjork 2011)</p><hr/><h2 id="Learning-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Learning-in-Practice">Learning in Practice</a><a id="Learning-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Learning-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h2><div class="admonition is-compat"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><p><code>TODO: write these</code></p></div></div><p><strong>Developing Conceptual Frameworks</strong>  </p><p><code>Check if should be an activity or not</code></p><p>An expert not only understands many concepts, but can relate them to each other, transfer principles across concepts, and easily add new knowledge to their framework.
