It is rooted in the principles of <strong>Universal Design</strong>, which is an approach to creating products environments, and experiences that are <strong>usable by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation or specialized design</strong>. UDL is based on the idea that learning should be engaging, relevant, and responsive to individual needs. Importantly, <strong>UDL aims to change thedesign of the environment rather than to change the learner.</strong></p><p>As we saw previously, <strong>Universal Design for Learning (UDL)</strong> <em>places accessibility at the forefront and leverages various AJEDI principles</em> for improving teaching and learning for all students. To help implement UDL in the classroom, the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) developed the <strong>UDL Guidelines</strong> (CAST, 2018). These are <em>a set of principles and strategies that aim to provide equal and inclusive access to learning for all students</em>, including those with disabilities or diverse learning styles. The guidelines provide specific recommendations for creating flexible and engaging learning environments and materials that can be customized to meet the diverse needs and preferences of all students.</p><p>The UDL Guidelines encompass <strong>three key principles:</strong> providing multiple means of (1) Engagement, (2) Representation, and (3) Action and Expression.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs10.jpeg" alt/></p><h3 id="UDL-Guidelines:-Multiple-Means-of-Representation"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#UDL-Guidelines:-Multiple-Means-of-Representation">UDL Guidelines: Multiple Means of Representation</a><a id="UDL-Guidelines:-Multiple-Means-of-Representation-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#UDL-Guidelines:-Multiple-Means-of-Representation" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>In this submodule, we will be focusing on the principle of providing <strong>multiple means of Representation.</strong> This principle outlines strategies for creating course materials that provide options for perception, language and symbols, and comprehension.</p><ul><li><strong>Perception:</strong> <em>Present information in a variety of formats</em>, such as visual, auditory, and tactile. Instructors can use this principle to ensure that textbooks, videos, lectures, and other course materials are accessible to all students, including those with disabilities or those who process information differently. By incorporating visual aids, videos, diagrams, and other interactive media, instructors provide multiple ways of representing important information and allow students to choose the means that work best for them.</li><li><strong>Language &amp; Symbols:</strong> <em>Use clear, concise, and accessible language and symbols and avoid language or symbols that may be exclusive, biased, or offensive.</em> This guideline aims to promote understanding and reduce barriers to learning by selecting language and symbols that are familiar and meaningful to all learners. This can be achieved by providing captioning, transcripts, and audio descriptions for multimedia content, incorporating pictures or symbols to represent concepts, and avoiding jargon or complex language whenever possible, and providing alternative means of representation for students with different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.</li><li><strong>Comprehension:</strong> <em>Incorporate a variety of instructional techniques to ensure that students can access, process, and assimilate new information and knowledge.</em> Instructors need to provide supports and scaffold curriculum to help students comprehend the material. This can include activating or providing prior knowledge; providing explicit cues or prompts to emphasize key elements, concepts, and features; embedding scaffolds and feedback to organize and process information; and incorporating opportunities for students to apply their knowledge to new contexts.</li></ul><p>For more information on the other two principles, visit the <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/">CAST UDL website</a>.</p><hr/><h2 id="Course-Structure-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Course-Structure-in-Practice">Course Structure in Practice</a><a id="Course-Structure-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Course-Structure-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h2><div class="admonition is-compat"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><ul><li>Communicating course structure to students</li><li>Structuring for Accessibility</li><li>Creating a High Structure Course</li></ul></div></div><h3 id="First-day-of-class"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#First-day-of-class">First day of class</a><a id="First-day-of-class-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#First-day-of-class" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Instructors might consider collaborating with various colleagues or resources as they design their course to meet UDL guidelines.

The <strong>conventional syllabus</strong> is <em>content-focused</em>, providing a brief overview of the course subject matter followed by a weekly outline of topics to be covered, and a list of assignments and course activities with relative grading weights and due dates.</p><p>A <strong>learner-centered syllabus</strong> also provides basic course information, but <strong>it shifts the emphasis</strong> from what the instructor will cover in the course <em>to what learning outcomes students will achieve by the end of the course</em> (Johnson, 2006). It explains how learning will be assessed and offers information and tools to promote student learning and intellectual development in an inclusive environment. It establishes the responsibilities of the instructor(s) and students for achieving course goals. In short, the learner-centered syllabus &quot;becomes an invitation to share responsibility for successful learning&quot; (O&#39;Brien et al., 2008, p. 22).</p><p>In his book, &quot;What the Best College Teachers Do,&quot; Ken Bain (2004) describes three parts of what he calls &quot;the promising syllabus&quot;:</p><ol><li><strong>Highlight the promises or opportunities.</strong><ul><li>What kinds of questions</li><li>will the course help students answer?</li><li>What kind of intellectual, physical, emotional, or social abilities will it help them develop?</li><li>Why is the course relevant?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Explain what students will do to meet those promises.</strong><ul><li>What are the learning activities (e.g., activities, assignments, readings) that will be used in the course?</li><li>How will they learn from the course resources, the instructional team, and each other?</li><li>Give students a sense of agency in their education</li></ul></li><li><strong>Discuss how students will engage in the learning process.</strong><ul><li>How will the instructor and students best &quot;understand the nature and progress of their learning?&quot;</li><li>How will learning be evaluated?</li><li>How will all students feel included in the learning process and welcome as scientists?</li></ul></li></ol><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Learner-Centered Syllabus</h4><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click to see an example excerpt of a learner-centered syllabus</summary><div class="admonition-body"><p>The following is excerpted from Dr. Cara Gormally&#39;s asynchronous introductory biology class for non-majors (bilingual-American Sign Language &amp; English).</p><p><strong>What we&#39;ll actually do</strong></p><ul><li>You&#39;re likely taking this class because it&#39;s required for your major.</li><li>My goal: make this class actually useful to your life.</li><li>Together, we&#39;ll make this class meaningful for ourselves.

I&#39;m committed to anti-racism and I believe Black Lives Matter. Everyone belongs here in my classroom if you want to be here. In this class, we&#39;ll use materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, national origin, ethnicity, race, culture, etc. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.</li><li><strong>You make our class what it is.</strong> Our class will be awesome because of the diversity of perspectives, thoughts, and experiences that we will share through our work. Who you are, what you bring to our class, your perspective–it&#39;s important.</li></ul></div></details><p>Now that you&#39;ve seen a learner-centered syllabus, reflect on your own syllabus. (If you do not have one, think about a traditional syllabus or one from a course you&#39;ve taken.) Think about the elements in a learner-centered syllabus and the components of your syllabus.</p><p>What are two things you could change in your syllabus to make it more learner-centered? You can use these prompts to help you re-imagine your syllabus:</p><ul><li>What are the promises or opportunities presented by the instructor?</li><li>What activities will students do in order to meet those promises?</li><li>How will students track progress of their learning (i.e., how will learning be evaluated)?</li></ul></div></div><!--

However, <em>the mere existence of a resource</em> <strong>does not by itself lead to equitable and inclusive outcomes.</strong></p><p><strong>Accessibility</strong> refers to the <em>design and creation of products, devices, environments, and content that can be used and accessed by all people</em>, including those with disabilities or other impairments. The goal of accessibility is to <strong>provide equal access and opportunities for everyone, regardless of their abilities</strong>, so that they can participate fully in all aspects of society. This includes considerations such as physical, digital, and social accessibility.</p><p>In the context of education, accessibility refers to the practice of creating learning environments, resources, and technologies that allow all students to access and engage with academic content and participate in learning activities.</p><ul><li><strong>Physical accessibility:</strong> Make physical spaces and materials accessible, such as by providing wheelchair ramps, captioning videos, and offering alternative formats of textbooks. </li><li><strong>Digital accessibility:</strong> Design digital content and technologies that are compatible with assistive technologies, such as screen readers and text-to-speech software.</li><li><strong>Social accessibility:</strong> Use inclusive language, accommodate different communication styles.</li></ul><h3 id="The-Need-for-Accessibility"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Need-for-Accessibility">The Need for Accessibility</a><a id="The-Need-for-Accessibility-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Need-for-Accessibility" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Students with disabilities face many challenges when seeking accommodations in higher education (Gin et al., 2020).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs24.png" alt/></p><p>An accessible course design <strong>reduces the need for accommodation, alleviates the burden and stigma</strong> associated with students seeking accommodations, <strong>saves time</strong> for educators, and <strong>diminishes the cost</strong> associated with providing individual accommodations. Importantly, accessibility <strong>improves educational outcomes for all learners</strong> by making sure that educational materials and resources are available and usable by everyone, regardless of their individual needs.</p><p>Universal Design for Learning (UDL) provides a framework that guides educators to create accessible course materials and flexible and inclusive learning experiences that meet the needs of all learners, regardless of their abilities or background. Why build a course with UDL at the forefront instead of accommodating student needs as they arise? Consider this passage from Rose and colleagues (2006):</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Such an environmental view fosters solutions that <strong>address the limitations of the learning environment</strong> rather than the limitations of the student, while making the student less of a problem, and <strong>more a part of diversity within the course</strong>. The advantage of such universal solutions is that, as with such approaches in built environments, they are likely to be useful for many individuals; <strong>built once, applied many times.</strong>&quot; (p. 150)</p></blockquote><p><em>Individuals with disabilities are highly underrepresented in STEM degree attainment and STEM employment.</em></p><p>Individuals with disabilities enter postsecondary education at a slightly higher percentage in which they are represented in the general population.

The structure of a course lies on a continuum from low to high. Low structure courses have few opportunities for engagement and assessment whereas high structure courses embed multiple opportunities for engagement and frequent assessments (Beck &amp; Roosa, 2020). Low structure courses assume that students know how to efficiently work with course materials in and outside of class. However, data suggest that many students do not implement effective study strategies nor time management skills (Hartwig &amp; Dunlosky, 2012). High structure courses scaffold student learning with increased engagement and practice and by decoding the learning process through clear and accessible learning goals and expectations (Beck &amp; Roosa, 2020).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs38.png" alt/></p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Examine the home pages for two courses, and identify which course is low structure and which one is high structure.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs39.png" alt/></p></div></div><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p><strong>Comparing Course Designs</strong></p><p>Examine the two course preparations below that describe one week of a course.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs40.png" alt/></p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs41.png" alt/></p><p>Which course looks more like yours and why?</p><p>If you haven&#39;t taught a course yet, which course preparation resonates with your experiences as a student?</p></div></div><h3 id="The-Impact-of-High-Structure-Courses"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Impact-of-High-Structure-Courses">The Impact of High Structure Courses</a><a id="The-Impact-of-High-Structure-Courses-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Impact-of-High-Structure-Courses" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Increasing a course&#39;s structure has many implications for student learning and their educational experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Student failure rates</strong> were lower in a moderately structured course design and were <strong>dramatically lower in a highly structured course design</strong> (Freeman et al., 2011)</li><li>A &quot;moderate-structure&quot; intervention <strong>increased course performance for all student populations</strong>, but worked <strong>disproportionately well for black students and first-generation students</strong>.
