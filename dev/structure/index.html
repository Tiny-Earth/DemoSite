High-structure courses embed multiple opportunities for engagement and frequent assessments, in contrast to low-structure courses that offer fewer (<a href="../refs/#beck2020designing">Beck and Roosa, 2020</a>; <a href="../refs/#freeman_increased_2011">Freeman <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>). Low-structure courses assume that students know how to effectively learn and practice with course materials on their own outside of class. However, many students have not developed effective study strategies or time management skills (<a href="../refs/#hartwig2012study">Hartwig and Dunlosky, 2012</a>). High-structure courses scaffold student learning with increased engagement and practice both in and outside of class. Therefore, they decode the learning process through clear and accessible learning goals and expectations which can be especially helpful for students from HECs (<a href="../refs/#eddy_getting_2014">Eddy and Hogan, 2014</a>; <a href="../refs/#beck2020designing">Beck and Roosa, 2020</a>). Low structure only benefits students who know how to decode the system. High structure benefits all students (<a href="../refs/#beck2020designing">Beck and Roosa, 2020</a>).</p><figure>

They serve as a guide for instructors to enact backward design and hold us accountable to create transparent, inclusive learning experiences in STEM. Course maps can be full of information or light on detail - whatever makes sense for teaching in your context. They provide a clear framework for learning objectives, assessments, and activities within each week of a course, allowing you to consider how learning experiences are scaffolded within and across weeks, and to consider alignment between overall course learning goals and objectives for each class session or week.</p><p>By applying high-structure course design principles, a course map can make learning expectations transparent and therefore the learning environment inclusive. A few examples were provided at the start of this module.</p><h3 id="Learner-centered-Syllabus"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Learner-centered-Syllabus">Learner-centered Syllabus</a><a id="Learner-centered-Syllabus-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Learner-centered-Syllabus" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The syllabus offers one of the first opportunities for instructors to welcome students to the course and begin building an inclusive learning environment within a STEM context. A basic syllabus provides logistical course information and a course schedule, but it can be so much more.</p><p>A learner-centered syllabus focuses on the learner and the learning by:</p><ul><li>Providing a welcome statement to signal that the students matter, they have a right to learn this material, and that they belong in this course and in STEM.</li><li>Establishing the responsibilities of the instructor(s) and students for achieving course goals.</li><li>Explaining how everyone will interact with each other and with the content.</li><li>Showing a clear schedule of all the course activities.</li><li>Conveying how and when learning will be assessed.</li><li>Offering information and tools to promote student learning and intellectual development.</li><li>Highlighting resources that support students and learning.</li><li>Signaling whether and how students have input regarding the course material, timing, assignments, etc.</li></ul><p>In short, the learner-centered syllabus &quot;becomes an invitation to share responsibility for successful learning&quot; (O&#39;Brien et al., 2008, p. 22). In contrast, a conventional syllabus focuses on covering the content and perhaps includes a weekly schedule of topics, assignment due dates, exams, and grading policies.</p><h2 id="Course-Structure-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Course-Structure-in-Practice">Course Structure in Practice</a><a id="Course-Structure-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Course-Structure-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h2><h3 id="Course-Maps"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Course-Maps">Course Maps</a><a id="Course-Maps-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Course-Maps" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>To help you structure your course in practice, several course maps exist.

This tool is structured as a questionnaire to help you start imagining and building learner-centered syllabi.</p><p>We encourage you to think about your course &quot;syllabus&quot; as a tool that is more broad than a single document. While the content of your formal syllabus may be dictated by your department or district, you can welcome your students to your course using a variety of materials that introduce them to you and your course, such as:</p><ul><li>Syllabus addenda</li><li>Welcome videos</li><li>Welcome emails</li><li>Slides or handouts presented on the first day of class</li><li>The homepage or first module on the course LMS</li><li>And many more!</li></ul><p>And so, we encourage all teachers, even those who do not have control to change their syllabus, to imagine all the ways they welcome students to their courses and provide students a roadmap for success.</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Learner-Centered Syllabus Materials</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>Examine the example learner-centered syllabus below. Then reflect on your own course&#39;s syllabus. Think about the elements in good a learner-centered syllabus compared with the elements of your own.</p><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click to see an example excerpt of a learner-centered syllabus</summary><div class="admonition-body"><p>The following is excerpted from Dr. Cara Gormally&#39;s asynchronous introductory biology class for non-majors (bilingual-American Sign Language &amp; English).</p><p><strong>What we&#39;ll actually do</strong></p><ul><li>You&#39;re likely taking this class because it&#39;s required for your major.</li><li>My goal: make this class actually useful to your life.</li><li>Together, we&#39;ll make this class meaningful for ourselves. How will we do that?</li><li>We&#39;ll learn biology relevant to our lives: when a person is most likely to get pregnant; how Covid-19 vaccines work; why we have skin color; how antidepressants work; what we can do to slow climate change; and why we should limit plastic use.</li><li>There&#39;s no textbook; we&#39;ll read and watch high quality enjoyable articles and videos.</li><li>We&#39;ll learn how to answer questions we have related to biology, for example about health or the environment.</li><li>I hope you&#39;re excited about our class–I am so excited to get to know you all and do this work together! This work feels real and important to me. I hope you think so, too.</li></ul><p><strong>Diversity: it makes our class better</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Build community through discussion:</strong> Though we won&#39;t meet face-to-face, we&#39;ll learn about each other and build a community through our discussions.</li><li><strong>Diversity strengthens us:</strong> The diversity that we all bring to this class is a resource, strength and benefit to our class. I&#39;m committed to anti-racism and I believe Black Lives Matter. Everyone belongs here in my classroom if you want to be here. In this class, we&#39;ll use materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, national origin, ethnicity, race, culture, etc. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.</li><li><strong>You make our class what it is.</strong> Our class will be awesome because of the diversity of perspectives, thoughts, and experiences that we will share through our work. Who you are, what you bring to our class, your perspective–it&#39;s important.</li></ul></div></details><p>Then, complete one of the following activities to create language you can use in your syllabus or other &quot;welcome to the course&quot; materials:</p><ul><li>Write 1-2 sentences to welcome students by conveying that the students matter, they have a right to learn this material, and that they belong in this course and in STEM.</li><li>Explain how the course is relevant to its students.</li><li>Explain how your students will engage with the facets of science.</li><li>Describe how your students may communicate with you.</li><li>Describe your expectations for how your students will work together on collaborative assignments and discussions.</li><li>Highlight a few ways that the course is accessible and how your students can find resources, including resources you provide and the university itself provides. (Tip: Universities in the US are required to publish a yearly Security and Fire Safety Report, which usually list university resources. These can be helpful places to start finding resources if your university does not already advertise them all in one place.)</li></ul></div></div><h2 id="Summary-of-Course-Structure"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Summary-of-Course-Structure">Summary of Course Structure</a><a id="Summary-of-Course-Structure-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Summary-of-Course-Structure" title="Permalink"></a></h2><ul><li>Inclusive course structure involves a course map and a learner-centered syllabus.</li><li>A course map provides a template for enacting backward design principles.</li><li>A learner-centered syllabus welcomes students to the course and to science by decoding how learning works in your course.</li><li>High-structure course design involves organizing a course with clearly defined expectations and a well-defined schedule.
