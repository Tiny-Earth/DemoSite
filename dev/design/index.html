knowledge. In designing a course, we set goals and adopt strategies for students to achieve learning objectives.</p><hr/><h2 id="Why-Course-Design?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Why-Course-Design?">Why Course Design?</a><a id="Why-Course-Design?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Why-Course-Design?" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>The aim of course design is to create directed, scaffolded learning experiences in which students engage repeatedly with the course material, each other, and the instructional team (Fink, 2013; Freeman et al., 2011; Wiggins &amp; McTighe, 2005; Wiggins &amp; McTighe, 2011).</p><p>Scientific teachers are designers: You select scientific content with purpose, organize it in a way that scaffolds learning, and evaluate how well it worked. And like in any type of design—from technology, to paintings, to skyscrapers, and yes, to science courses—you make decisions that influence outcomes.</p><p>Your decisions help you achieve your aims and support student learning, within your constraints. You make decisions about your teaching before the semester begins, while teaching a unit, and after each term ends. From designing new courses to overhauling an old design you inherited to continuously improving your teaching, as a scientific teacher you are as much a designer as you are a scientist and an educator.</p><p>In all three of these roles—teacher, scientist, designer—you hold a number of commitments that inspire and inform how you carry out your course (Flanagan et al., 2005; Flanagan and Nissenbaum, 2014; Belman et al., 2009). As an instructor, you are likely committed to engaging students in meeting the learning objectives of your courses. As a scientist, you may be committed to a certain level of rigor and experimentation in your work. As a scientific teacher you may be committed to having your students experience scientific discoveries through those lenses. And as a designer, you plan, you adapt, you iterate.</p><p>Only you can know what your own commitments are, and only you can know the ways they:</p><ul><li>Shape what you aspire to achieve in your work as a scientific teacher</li><li>Motivate you to pursue your own degree of quality</li><li>Guide you to explore and weigh between design alternatives</li><li>Inform how you engage with your students</li><li>Define how you want students to engage with the content and each other</li></ul><p>This module asks you to reflect on your commitments and apply a course design framework called “backward design”. Other modules provide suggestions for activities, assessments, and other considerations to fill out the course learning experiences.</p><h3 id="Effective-Design-of-STEM-Courses"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Effective-Design-of-STEM-Courses">Effective Design of STEM Courses</a><a id="Effective-Design-of-STEM-Courses-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Effective-Design-of-STEM-Courses" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Effective design principles incorporate balance and alignment, while focusing on the end product and user experience.

We connect the science to historical legacies of exclusion and privilege in science. Everything for class is on our learning management system, which ensures students can find materials even if they miss class. I have built a lot of structure in my course such as pre-class readings with quizzes and post-class reflection assignments to help students monitor and progress their learning. I use frequent low-stakes assessments with timely feedback, and I make sure to tell them it&#39;s ok to make mistakes.

It asks instructors to define what learning and understanding mean for their course context (e.g, student preparation, course level, and content) and then design curriculum “backward” from there.</p><p>A three-step process known as <strong>backward design</strong> supports Understanding by Design. It is called “backward” because it starts with the end goals in mind and then designs learning experiences that guide students toward those goals. In contrast, a “forward” approach focuses on covering content, delivering instruction, and then developing assessments based on what has been taught. Because learning outcomes come last, the “forward” approach may lead to weak alignment between learning goals and assessments, leaving students to guess what is important and where to focus their study efforts.</p><p>The process of backward design is meant to be flexible and iterative, not prescriptive. Framed within the context of STEM, the process of backward design typically involves three stages:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Identify desired results.</strong> What should students know, understand, and be able to do? Which facets of science should students understand, and to what level of competency? What enduring understandings or transfer of knowledge are desired?</p><p><em>Action: Establish learning objectives based on the facets of science.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Determine acceptable evidence.</strong> What evidence will demonstrate progress toward understanding those facets of science at those levels of competency? How will student performance be evaluated in fair and consistent ways?</p><p><em>Action: Create equitable assessments that measure progress toward the objectives.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Plan learning experiences and instruction.</strong> What activities could engage students with the facets of science and scaffold their learning? How will learners be supported as they come to understand important ideas and processes? What activities, sequence, and resources are best suited to accomplish the desired goals?</p><p><em>Action: Design inclusive learning experiences that support learners in understanding the facets of science.</em></p></li></ul><hr/><h2 id="Course-Design-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Course-Design-in-Practice">Course Design in Practice</a><a id="Course-Design-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Course-Design-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h2><h3 id="Step-1:-Identify-desired-results."><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Step-1:-Identify-desired-results.">Step 1: Identify desired results.</a><a id="Step-1:-Identify-desired-results.-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Step-1:-Identify-desired-results." title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Learning goals and objectives are two key components of instructional design that guide the development of curriculum and assessments.</p><p><strong>Learning goals</strong> emphasize enduring understanding. These are broad descriptions of what students will understand and learn as a result of engaging with the curriculum. They describe the overall purpose of an instructional unit with respect to the facets of science, inclusive learning expectations, or any other aspiration for the curriculum. Learning goals are often linked to the even broader goals of an academic program.</p><p>For example:</p><blockquote><p>Goal: Understand the impact of climate change on agriculture and health.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Learning objectives</strong> are action-oriented, measurable statements that state what knowledge and skills students are expected to demonstrate as a result of engaging with the curriculum. Objectives are more specific than learning goals and are designed to be achievable within a particular time frame and level of instruction.</p><p>For example:</p><blockquote><p>Objective: Compare and contrast the role of soil vs. air as a carbon sink.</p></blockquote><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>TODO activity name</h4><p>Which of the following statements are learning goals, and which are learning objectives?</p><ul><li>Code, test, and debug simple algorithms using a programming language such as Python.</li><li>Understand how sustainable engineering practices affect the environment.</li><li>Appreciate the relevance of physics in technology, engineering, and medicine.</li><li>Apply safe techniques for preparing and handling laboratory chemicals.</li><li>Identify and manipulate algebraic expressions, including equations, inequalities, and functions.</li><li>Understand the relationship between physical structure and physiological function at the cellular and systemic levels.</li></ul></div></div><h3 id="Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals">Writing Effective Learning Goals</a><a id="Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Learning goals describe broad outcomes at the course-level. An instructor may have only a few learning goals for an entire course. Think about the main ideas listed on your course website or the top of your syllabus—they are probably goals.</p><p>Because a goal is not directly measured by a single assessment question, it can use terms such as understand and appreciate, which should be avoided for learning objectives.</p><p>To write an effective learning goal, we suggest the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Think about long-term transfer goals.</strong> What would you want students to be able to do with the knowledge they gain from the course?</li><li><strong>Consider enduring understanding.</strong> What would you want your students to remember or understand 5 years from now?</li><li><strong>Goals can be ambitious and even philosophical.</strong> They communicate that &quot;big picture&quot; feeling to the students.</li><li><strong>Write goals in broad terms</strong> but with enough specificity to provide purpose and direction for instructional design.</li></ul><p>For example:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Course Goals:</strong></p><ul><li>Students will understand the water cycle as a complex process that involves the continuous movement and transformation of water through the environment.</li><li>Students will recognize the importance of the water cycle in sustaining life on earth and the implications of human activity on this process.</li><li>Students will develop critical thinking skills to analyze and evaluate the impact of changes in the water cycle on ecosystems and human societies.</li></ul></blockquote><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>TODO activity name</h4><p>The following learning goals come from Professor Nguyen&#39;s earth science syllabus:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Students will explain the causes and effects of plate tectonics and how this process has shaped the surface of the Earth over millions of years.</li><li>Students will explore the structure and composition of the Earth&#39;s interior and the relationship between geologic features such as mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes.</li><li>Students will understand Earth&#39;s natural systems.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Write feedback you would give to Professor Nguyen if they were your peer, such as:</p><ul><li>Areas that are too specific or too broad.</li><li>If a statement is a learning objective, not a goal.</li><li>Modifications to make the statement into a more effective learning goal.</li></ul></div></div><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>TODO above title + Now You Try</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>Choose one:</p><ul><li>Select an existing learning goal from your course.

Although learning objectives are often content-focused, they can also include gaining competence in a new skill or developing a certain type of knowledge or expertise. Learning objectives should be designed to be achievable and realistic, but also challenging enough to promote growth and progress.</p><p>To write an effective learning objective, we suggest the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Start with an action verb.</strong> An effective learning objective should begin with a strong verb that describes the specific competency that students are expected to demonstrate. Examples of commonly used verbs include &quot;identify,&quot; &quot;analyze,&quot; &quot;describe,&quot; &quot;compare,&quot; &quot;explain,&quot; and &quot;design.&quot;</li><li><strong>Be specific.</strong> The objective should clearly state what the student is expected to learn or achieve. Avoid vague or overly general language that could be open to interpretation.</li><li><strong>Be concrete.</strong> The objective should be written in a way that allows the student&#39;s progress or achievement to be measured directly. Use language that makes clear how knowledge is being assessed.</li><li><strong>Be realistic.</strong> The objective should be achievable within the context of the course unit and based on a reasonable level of prior knowledge or skill.</li><li><strong>Align with learning goals.</strong> The objective should align with a larger learning goal.</li></ul><h3 id="Bloom&#39;s-Taxonomy"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Bloom&#39;s-Taxonomy">Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy</a><a id="Bloom&#39;s-Taxonomy-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Bloom&#39;s-Taxonomy" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Bloom’s Taxonomy categorizes several domains of educational goals based on the level of complexity and specificity (Bloom, 1956; Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001) and can be helpful in writing learning objectives. The taxonomy of the cognitive domain consists of six levels ranging from lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS) to higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS):</p><ul><li><strong>Remember:</strong> Can the learner recall or retain the information? <em>Action verbs: define, duplicate, identify, list, memorize, name, recall, recognize, repeat, state</em></li><li><strong>Comprehend:</strong> Can the learner explain ideas or concepts? <em>Action verbs: classify, describe, discuss, explain, locate, paraphrase, report, select, summarize, translate</em></li><li><strong>Apply:</strong> Can the learner use information in a new way? <em>Action verbs: choose, demonstrate, dramatize, draw, employ, execute, illustrate, implement, interpret, operate, perform, sketch, solve, use</em></li><li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Can the learner distinguish between different parts? <em>Action verbs: compare, contrast, deconstruct, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, infer, investigate, organize, predict, question, test</em></li><li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> Can the learner justify a stand or decision? <em>Action verbs: appraise, argue, assess, criticize, critique, defend, judge, justify, prioritize, support, value</em></li><li><strong>Create:</strong> Can the learner create a new product or point of view? <em>Action verbs: assemble, build, compose, construct, design, develop, devise, formulate, invent, plan, produce, write</em></li></ul><p><img src="../assets/Blooms_one-topic.png" alt="Example learning objectives across all six levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy based on one STEM topic (the water cycle)."/></p><p><img src="../assets/Blooms_multiple-topics.png" alt="Example learning objectives across all six levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy using multiple STEM topics."/></p><p>In designing learning objectives, select action verbs that communicate the desired cognitive level.

Determine acceptable evidence.</a><a id="Step-2.-Determine-acceptable-evidence.-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Step-2.-Determine-acceptable-evidence." title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Once you have learning objectives that are aligned to learning goals, the next step is to determine what evidence will acceptably demonstrate that students are progressing toward—and eventually succeeding in accomplishing—the desired outcomes. This requires that we design assessments that are aligned to the learning objectives.</p><p>Why is this such a critical step? Because assessment drives learning. When students have opportunities to practice the material they are learning, they are better able to diagnose their understanding and can change their study strategies, if necessary. These strategies are effective in improving learning gains (Hartwig and Dunlosky, 2012; Sebesta and Speth, 2017). Misalignment between learning objectives and assessments can negatively impact student performance (O&#39;Neill, et al., 2010). This creates uncertainty for students about where to focus their study efforts, which is the opposite of an inclusive learning environment.</p><p>Imagine studying for an exam by solving problems and designing potential experiments, only to find that the exam is all memorization. A student may rightfully feel frustrated, thinking they &quot;wasted time&quot; studying the wrong material.</p><p>Now imagine the opposite scenario, where a student presumes the exam will have lower-order cognitive questions, but the exam has mostly higher-order cognitive questions. The student is unlikely to perform well and will be frustrated that the course materials did not adequately prepare them for the exam.</p><p>In both cases, the students’ study strategies are misaligned with the objectives of the exam. When students have the chance to practice the skills they are expected to learn, and those are the skills on which they are tested, it creates a less frustrating and more equitable learning environment for everyone.</p><h3 id="Step-3.-Plan-learning-experiences-and-instruction."><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Step-3.-Plan-learning-experiences-and-instruction.">Step 3.

We will explore developing activities in more detail in the <em>Learning Experiences</em> module. For now, we&#39;ll highlight a few key ideas.</p><p>What students practice (in-class activities) should align with assessment questions to ensure students have an opportunity to practice and eventually demonstrate proficiency with the intended learning objectives. For example, it would be unfair to ask students to analyze graphs on an exam if students had never practiced analyzing figures during class or on homework assignments. An instructor cannot conclude how well their curriculum advanced students&#39; abilities to analyze graphs based on exam performance. Since the students did not have any opportunities to practice, their exam performance is based on prior knowledge, skills, and experiences, not from <em>this</em> curriculum.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at an example of a learning objective and assessment question:</p><blockquote><p>Learning objective: Students will be able to explain the connections between the various stages of the water cycle.</p><p>Assessment question: In what ways does the stage of infiltration rely on the previous stages of the water cycle, like precipitation and surface runoff?</p></blockquote><p>What might be an appropriate activity for students to gain practice toward answering the assessment question? Some options might be:</p><ul><li>Students construct a diagram that shows each stage of the water cycle. They label each stage and explain how water moves through the cycle.</li><li>Students watch a video of someone conducting an soil absorption experiment using sand, gravel, and clay. Students discuss how much water is absorbed from the simulated precipitation and simulated runoff.</li><li>Students design an experiment to measure how much water is absorbed by different soil types.</li><li>Students compare and contrast how the water cycle varies depending on the climate, such as a tropical rainforest versus a desert.</li></ul><p>We will practice writing assessments and creating learning experiences in the modules about <em>Learning Experiences</em> and <em>Summative Assessment</em>, so hold onto the learning objective(s) you wrote!</p><h3 id="Step-4.-Check-alignment-within-curriculum-and-values."><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Step-4.-Check-alignment-within-curriculum-and-values.">Step 4.

However, the mere existence of a resource does not by itself lead to equitable and inclusive outcomes.</p><p>Students with disabilities face many challenges when seeking accommodations in higher education (Gin et al., 2020). An accessible course design reduces the need for accommodation, alleviates the burden and stigma associated with students seeking accommodations, saves time for educators, and diminishes the cost associated with providing individual accommodations. Importantly, accessibility improves educational outcomes for all learners by making sure that educational materials and resources are available and usable by everyone, regardless of their individual needs.</p><p><strong>Universal Design for Learning (UDL)</strong> guides educators to create accessible course materials and flexible and inclusive learning experiences that meet the needs of all learners, regardless of their abilities or background (CAST, 2018).</p><p><strong>UDL aims to change the design of the environment rather than to change the learner.</strong> By adopting the principles of UDL, an instructor can build an inclusive course from the outset. The UDL guidelines (CAST, 2018) encompass three key principles: providing multiple means of engagement, representation, and action and expression. Some examples include:</p><ul><li><strong>Physical accessibility:</strong> Make physical spaces and materials accessible, such as by providing wheelchair ramps, captioning videos, and offering alternative formats of textbooks.</li><li><strong>Digital accessibility:</strong> Design digital content and technologies that are compatible with assistive technologies, such as screen readers and text-to-speech software.</li><li><strong>Social accessibility:</strong> Use inclusive language, accommodate different communication styles.</li></ul><hr/><h2 id="Summary-of-Course-Design"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Summary-of-Course-Design">Summary of Course Design</a><a id="Summary-of-Course-Design-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Summary-of-Course-Design" title="Permalink"></a></h2><ul><li>Backward design is an approach to course or curriculum design that involves starting with the end goals or objectives and then designing assessments and activities that align with those goals.</li><li>Learning goals and learning objectives are the desired results—statements that explain what learners are expected to achieve—but they differ in their level of specificity and scope. Both are informed by enduring understanding and the future ability to use the knowledge.</li><li>Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy is a framework for categorizing educational goals and objectives into a hierarchy of six levels, ranging from simple recall of facts to complex, analytical thinking. By using Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy to guide learning objectives, educators can design learning experiences that promote deeper understanding and critical thinking.</li><li>Learning objectives, assessments, and learning experiences communicate what is important and valued.
