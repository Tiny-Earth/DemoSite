Your decisions help you approach your aims, within your constraints. You’ll make decisions about your teaching before the semester begins, while teaching a unit, and after you’ve seen how it all played out.

--><h3 id="Backward-Design"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Backward-Design">Backward Design</a><a id="Backward-Design-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Backward-Design" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Backward design is an instructional approach that emphasizes starting with the end goals in mind (Wiggins &amp; McTighe, 2005). What should students know or be able to do after instruction? What are the desired results after the course or a lesson? Once you have identified these goals, you can design the curriculum such that students can achieve the goals.</p><p>The process of backward design typically involves three stages:</p><ol><li>Establishing learning goals and objectives: What skills and knowledge should students learn?</li><li>Creating assessments that match those objectives: What evidence is needed to know if students have gained the skills and knowledge?</li><li>Designing learning experiences (instructional materials and activities) that will help students achieve those objectives: What activities will teach these skills and knowledge?</li></ol><p>Although backward design emphasizes starting with the end in mind, the process itself is not always strictly linear or sequential.</p><p>Educators may revisit stages of the backward design process multiple times to refine goals/objectives, assessments, and learning experiences. Additionally, backward design allows for flexibility in adjusting instructional strategies based on ongoing assessment of student needs and progress. This may result in revisions throughout the learning process, which may not adhere to a strictly &quot;backward&quot; order.</p><p>And importantly, this approach focuses on what students should be able to do as a result of their learning.</p><p>By prioritizing learning objectives, teachers are able to create more targeted and effective instruction that is better aligned with the needs of their students, rather than designing materials based on covering a certain amount of content.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Compare Two Courses</h4><p>Two professors are covering the same learning objective and using the same assessment in their introductory science courses.</p><ul><li>Objective: Using the scientific methods, design an experiment based on a given hypothesis.</li><li>Assessment: Given the results of an experiment on antibiotic resistance, design a follow-up experiment that tests a revised hypothesis.</li></ul><p>They have both planned various activities to meet the learning objective:</p><figure>

The taxonomy consists of six levels, where each level builds upon the prior (McNulty 2019):</p><ol><li><strong>Remember:</strong> Can the learner recall or retain the information? Action verbs: define, duplicate, list, memorize, recall, repeat, state</li><li><strong>Comprehend:</strong> Can the learner explain ideas or concepts? Action verbs: classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognize, report, select, translate, paraphrase</li><li><strong>Apply:</strong> Can the learner use information in a new way? Action verbs: choose, demonstrate, dramatize, employ, illustrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch, solve, use, write</li><li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Can the learner distinguish between different parts? Action verbs: approause, compare, contrast, criticize, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test</li><li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> Can the learner justify a stand or decision? Action verbs: appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, evaluate</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> Can the learner create a new product or point of view? Action verbs: assemble, construct, create, design, develop, forumlate, write</li></ol><p>The framework is used to progressively move learners based on their prior knowledge and abilities from lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS) to higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS).</p><p>Action verbs appropriate for each level can be chosen to communicate the cognitive level of the objective or assessment.</p><p>There are many other ways to characterize cognitive levels; we recommend Bloom&#39;s taxonomy because it is straightforward and easy to use.</p><p>However, since it can be difficult to distinguish between the 6 levels of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy, we prefer to divide Bloom&#39;s by LOCS and HOCS.</p><p>In general, levels 1 and 2 are LOCS and levels 3-6 are HOCS. But depending on the context and what information the student is given, exercises written for higher Bloom&#39;s levels such as levels 3 (Apply) and 5 (Evaluate) can be considered LOCS. Often, the distinction depends on the novelty of the task. For example, if students do an evaluation activity in class (HOCS) and encounter the same exercise on an assessment, then it&#39;s no longer an evaluation, but a recall task (LOCS) that reinforces what was learned in class.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Practice Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy</h4><p>For each assessment prompt below, identify if targets a lower-order cognitive skill (LOCS) or higher-order cognitive skill (HOCS):</p><ol><li>Design an experiment to test one of Newton&#39;s laws of motion, including the necessary equipment, data collection methods, and analysis.</li><li>Use Figure 3 in the textbook to draw your own model that demonstrates one or more of Newton&#39;s laws of motion, including the necessary variables and assumptions.</li><li>Define Isaac Newton&#39;s three laws of motion, including examples of each.</li><li>Critique the validity of an experiment or study that uses Newton&#39;s laws of motion to explain a physical phenomenon, including its limitations and potential sources of error.</li><li>Explain the difference between mass and weight.</li><li>Considering the forces acting on an object in motion (direction and magnitude), predict the resultant motion of the object using Newton&#39;s laws.</li></ol></div></div><hr/><h2 id="Course-Design-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Course-Design-in-Practice">Course Design in Practice</a><a id="Course-Design-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Course-Design-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h2><div class="admonition is-compat"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><p><code>NOTE: This content was restructured recently.

They describe the overall goal or purpose of an instructional unit, and do not have to be directly measurable with a single assessment. A learning goal can be focused on behavior, skills, or content, and should be linked to the even broader goals of a curriculum or program.</li><li><strong>Learning objectives</strong> are specific, action-oriented, and measurable statements that describe the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate as a result of their learning. Objectives are narrower and more focused than learning goals and are designed to be achievable within a particular time frame and level of instruction. Learning objectives are aligned to learning goals, and achievement of specific learning objectives should lead to progression towards a learning goal.</li></ul><p>One way to visualize the difference between the two is to think about learning goals as the destination on a map or GPS, while learning objectives are the individual steps or directions that must be followed to reach that destination.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Identify Goals and Objectives</h4><p>Which of the following statements are learning goals, and which are learning objectives?</p><ul><li>Code, test, and debug simple algorithms using programming languages such as Python or Java.</li><li>Foster an understanding of the ethical and social responsibilities of engineers and their role in sustainable development and environmental protection.</li><li>Appreciate the relevance of physics in various fields, such as technology, engineering, and medicine.</li><li>Display proper techniques for preparing and handling laboratory chemicals, including safety methods and hazard precautions.</li><li>Identify and manipulate algebraic expressions, including equations, inequalities, and functions, using appropriate rules of algebra.</li><li>Understand the relationship between physical structure and physiological function at the cellular and systemic levels.</li></ul></div></div><h3 id="Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals">Writing Effective Learning Goals</a><a id="Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Writing-Effective-Learning-Goals" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Learning goals are at a larger scale than learning objectives, describing broad outcomes at the course-level.</p><p>An instructor may have only five or so learning goals for an entire course.

Use concrete, observable terms that can be assessed through a variety of methods, such as tests, projects, or essays.</li><li><strong>Be realistic:</strong> The objective should be achievable within the context of the course unit and based on a reasonable level of prior knowledge or skill.</li><li><strong>Align with learning goals:</strong> The objective should align with a larger learning goal.</li></ul><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Align Goals and Objectives</h4><p>For each learning objective below, describe how it aligns with one or more specific learning goals further below:</p><p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p><ol><li>Describe the water cycle and its different stages, including precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, surface runoff, and groundwater storages.</li><li>Explain the connections between the various stages of the water cycle.</li><li>Analyze the human impact on the water cycle, including deforestation, urbanization, and climate change.</li><li>Predict how changes to the natural water cycle process from human activities affect other lifeforms on Earth.</li><li>Evaluate the effects of droughts, floods, and water pollution on various civilizations around the globe.</li></ol><p><strong>Goals:</strong></p><ol><li>Students will understand the water cycle as a complex process that involves the continuous movement and transformation of water through the environment.</li><li>Students will recognize the importance of the water cycle in sustaining life on earth and the implications of human activity on this process.</li><li>Students will develop critical thinking skills to analyze and evaluate the impact of changes in the water cycle on ecosystems and human societies.</li></ol></div></div><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Raising Learning Objective Bloom Levels</h4><p>Professor Kim realizes that many of the learning objectives for his botany course are at the Remember level of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy (Level 1).</p><p>To ensure that his students go beyond mere memorization and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, Professor Kim needs to articulate learning objectives for higher order skills.</p><p>One objective he needs to reword is:</p><blockquote><p>Label the parts of a plant cell and recall their functions, including the cell wall, nucleus, chloroplasts, and mitochondria.</p></blockquote><p>Help Professor Kim by rewriting this objective into two new learning objectives at two different Bloom&#39;s levels above Level 1.</p><p>You can use this list of action verbs to help reword the objective:</p><ol><li><strong>Remember:</strong> assemble, construct, create, design, develop, forumlate, write</li><li><strong>Comprehend:</strong> appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, evaluate</li><li><strong>Apply:</strong> approause, compare, contrast, criticize, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test</li><li><strong>Analyze:</strong> choose, demonstrate, dramatize, employ, illustrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch, solve, use, write</li><li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognize, report, select, translate, paraphrase</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> define, duplicate, list, memorize, recall, repeat, state</li></ol></div></div><h3 id="Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments">Determine acceptable evidence and align objectives with assessments</a><a id="Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Determine-acceptable-evidence-and-align-objectives-with-assessments" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Once you have learning objectives that are aligned to learning goals, the next step is to design assessments that are aligned to the learning objectives.</p><p>Why is this such a critical step?

Since this learning objective is at the Comprehend level, the assessment should test student knowledge at the Comprehend level. Some options might be:</p><ul><li>Give an example of how the process of condensation leads to precipitation in the water cycle.</li><li>Compare the connections in two models of the water cycle.</li><li>In what ways does the stage of infiltration rely on the previous stages of the water cycle, like precipitation and surface runoff?</li></ul><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Align Objectives and Assessments: Part One</h4><p>Compare the following learning objective with a test item.

Now it&#39;s time to design the activities.</p><p>We will explore developing activities in more detail in a later module. For now, we&#39;ll highlight a few key ideas.</p><p>Activities should be aligned with assessment questions to ensure that students are given the opportunity to practice and demonstrate proficiency in the intended learning objectives. For example, it would be unfair to ask students to analyze graphs on an exam if students had never practiced analyzing figures during class or on homework assignments.</p><p>In addition, this alignment maximizes the effectiveness of the instructional design and enables accurate measurement of student learning outcomes. Continuing the last example, an instructor cannot conclude how well their curriculum advanced students&#39; abilities to analyze graphs based on exam performance. Since the students did not have any opportunities to practice, their exam performance is based on prior knowledge, skills, and experiences, not on learning of class content.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at the previous example of a learning objective and assessment question.</p><blockquote><p>Learning Objective: Students will be able to explain the connections between the various stages of the water cycle.</p><p>Assessment: In what ways does the stage of infiltration rely on the previous stages of the water cycle, like precipitation and surface runoff?</p></blockquote><p>What might be an appropriate activity for students to gain practice toward answering the assessment question? Some options might be:</p><ul><li>Students construct a diagram that shows each stage of the water cycle. They can label each stage and explain how water moves through the cycle.</li><li>Students watch a video of someone conducting an soil absorption experiment using sand, gravel, and clay. Students then discuss how much water is absorbed from the simulated precipitation and simulated runoff.</li><li>Students compare and contrast how the water cycle varies depending on the climate, such as a tropical rainforest versus a desert.</li></ul><p>As before, activities should be aligned to the Bloom&#39;s level of the assessment questions. In this example, the learning objective, assessment, and activity are all at a lower-order cognitive level. If an instructor wishes to include assessments at a higher-order level, then additional activities must be designed to help progress students to that level.</p><p>Ideally, multiple activities are leveraged to help students get more practice, gain expertise toward higher-order skills, and engage a diversity of students in learning.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Align Objectives and Assessments: Part Two</h4><p>Professor Gupta has the following assessment question in their astronomy class:</p><blockquote><p>Astronomers have discovered a new star and have been collecting data on it such as its size, temperature, and luminosity.

In particular, we can influence the course climate–the overall learning environment in a classroom or educational setting–to be more inclusive (Dewsbury &amp; Brame, 2019).

It could also indicate that the individuals in the room are passionate or enthusiastic about a particular topic or idea, which can make others feel anxious or apprehensive about engaging.

The classroom environment may be overtly hostile to students based on race, gender, socioeconomic or other status, ability, or other demographic factors.</li><li>🧊 <strong>Cold:</strong> The atmosphere is unfavorable, unfriendly, or unwelcoming.

Instructors and students both bring many identities to the classroom, and these identities influence how people choose to present themselves, communicate with others, and engage with the content.</p><p>These social dynamics and interactions shape the classroom environment and affect how students experience the learning space. Instructors who choose to share their social and/or professional identities send a message to students that it is also okay for them to share their identities in the classroom, be their authentic self, and bring all of who they are to their work.</p><p>Further, the identities that an instructor presents or that are perceived by students impact students&#39; motivation, engagement, and sense of belonging.</p><p>For example, instructors who are approachable, open-minded, and understanding can create a safe space where students feel comfortable expressing their opinions and asserting themselves. Instructors who openly value and bring diversity, inclusion, and cultural awareness into their teaching demonstrate to students that diversity is respected and encouraged.</p><p>Through sharing and thoughtful integration of one&#39;s identities into the course, instructors can cultivate positive relationships with their students, leading to enhanced learning outcomes, a sense of belonging, and persistence in STEM (Estrada et al., 2011).</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Reflect on Identity in Teaching Contexts</h4><p><em>Answer in your workbook:</em></p><p>Take a few minutes to reflect on your various social and professional identities.

Studies have shown that both course and campus climate affect many aspects related to a student&#39;s educational experience.</p><figure>
