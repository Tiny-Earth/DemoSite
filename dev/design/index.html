You make decisions - before, during, and after the term - that help you achieve your aims and support student learning. As a teacher, scientist, and designer, you hold a number of commitments that inspire and inform how you carry out your course (<a href="../refs/#flanagan2005values">Flanagan <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>; <a href="../refs/#flanagan2014values">Flanagan and Nissenbaum, 2014</a>; <a href="../refs/#belman2009instructional">Belman <em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>). </p><p>These commitments:</p><ul><li>Shape what you aspire to achieve in your work as a scientific teacher</li><li>Motivate you to pursue your own degree of quality</li><li>Guide you to explore and weigh between design alternatives</li><li>Inform how you engage with your students</li><li>Define how you want students to engage with the content and each other</li></ul><p>In this module, you will reflect on your commitments while you apply a course design framework called “backward design”.

Everything for class is on our learning management system, which ensures students can find materials even if they miss class. I have built a lot of structure in my course such as pre-class readings with quizzes and post-class reflection assignments to help students monitor and progress their learning. I use frequent low-stakes assessments with timely feedback, and I make sure to tell them it&#39;s ok to make mistakes.

It asks instructors to define what learning and understanding mean for their course context (e.g, student preparation, course level, and content) and then design curriculum “backward” from there.</p><p>A three-step process known as <strong>backward design</strong> supports Understanding by Design. It is called “backward” because it starts with the end goals in mind and then designs learning experiences that guide students toward those goals. As such, it shifts the teacher&#39;s focus from what they will do, to what they intend the students to learn. In contrast, a “forward” approach focuses on covering content, delivering instruction, and then developing assessments based on what has been taught. Because evaluating what was learned comes last, the “forward” approach may lead to weak alignment between learning goals and assessments, leaving students to guess what is important and where to focus their study efforts.</p><p>The process of backward design is meant to be flexible rather than prescriptive. During the course desgin process, you move through the steps iteratively, making sure that the learning objecties are aligned with assessments and learning experiences so that students are supporeed in achiveing the desired outcomes as you plan each course component. Framed within the context of STEM, the process of backward design typically involves three stages:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Identify desired results.</strong> What should students know, understand, and be able to do? Which facets of science should students understand, and to what level of competency? What enduring understandings or transfer of knowledge are desired?</p><p><em>Action: Establish learning objectives based on the facets of science.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Determine acceptable evidence.</strong> What evidence will demonstrate progress toward understanding those facets of science at those levels of competency? How will student performance be evaluated in fair and consistent ways?</p><p><em>Action: Create equitable assessments that measure progress toward the objectives.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Plan learning experiences and instruction.</strong> What activities could engage students with the facets of science and scaffold their learning? How will learners be supported as they come to understand important ideas and processes? What activities, sequence, and resources are best suited to accomplish the desired goals?</p><p><em>Action: Design inclusive learning experiences that support learners in understanding the facets of science.</em></p></li></ul><p>Backward design is a process that enables us to approach our teaching scientifically. Similar to how we design a research study with identifying a hypothesis and then determining the steps to test it, in backward design we plan our desired results, then intentionally plan the approach we will use to achieve them. It is most successful when we evaluate the extent to which our plan accomplished what was intended. </p><h2 id="Course-Design-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Course-Design-in-Practice">Course Design in Practice</a><a id="Course-Design-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Course-Design-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h2><h3 id="Step-1:-Identify-desired-results."><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Step-1:-Identify-desired-results.">Step 1: Identify desired results.</a><a id="Step-1:-Identify-desired-results.-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Step-1:-Identify-desired-results." title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Learning goals and objectives are two key components of instructional design that guide the development of curriculum and assessments.</p><figure>

An instructor may have only a few learning goals for an entire course. Think about the main ideas listed on your course website or the top of your syllabus—they are probably goals.</p><p>Because a goal is not directly measured by a single assessment question, it can use vague, difficult to measure terms such as understand and appreciate, which should be avoided for learning objectives.</p><p>To write an effective learning goal, we suggest the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Think about long-term transfer goals.</strong> What would you want students to be able to do with the knowledge they gain from the course?</li><li><strong>Consider enduring understanding.</strong> What would you want your students to remember or understand 5 years from now?</li><li><strong>Goals can be ambitious and even philosophical.</strong> They communicate that &quot;big picture&quot; feeling to the students.</li><li><strong>Write goals in broad terms</strong> but with enough specificity to provide purpose and direction for instructional design.</li></ul><p>For example:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Course Goals:</strong></p><ul><li>Students will understand the water cycle as a complex process that involves the continuous movement and transformation of water through the environment.</li><li>Students will recognize the importance of the water cycle in sustaining life on earth and the implications of human activity on this process.</li><li>Students will develop critical thinking skills to analyze and evaluate the impact of changes in the water cycle on ecosystems and human societies.</li><li>Students will understand how individuals from different backgrounds contribute to soling water-related challenges in various careers.</li></ul></blockquote><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Help Professor Nguyen</h4><p>The following learning goals come from Professor Nguyen&#39;s earth science syllabus:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Students will explain the causes and effects of plate tectonics and how this process has shaped the surface of the Earth over millions of years.</li><li>Students will explore the structure and composition of the Earth&#39;s interior and the relationship between geologic features such as mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes.</li><li>Students will understand Earth&#39;s natural systems.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Write feedback you would give to Professor Nguyen if they were your peer, such as:</p><ul><li>Areas that are too specific or too broad.</li><li>If a statement is a learning objective, not a goal.</li><li>Modifications to make the statement into a more effective learning goal.</li></ul></div></div><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Help Professor Nguyen: Now You Try!</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>Above, we asked you to imagine the third week/day for your course and refine your learning objectives for that moment in time.</p><p>Select one of those objectives.

Although learning objectives are often content-focused, they can also include gaining competence in a new skill, or shifting beliefs, attitudes, or perspectives. Learning objectives should be designed to be achievable and realistic within a given time frame, but also challenging enough to promote growth and progress.</p><p>To write an effective learning objective, we suggest the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Start with an action verb.</strong> An effective learning objective should begin with a strong verb that describes the specific competency that students are expected to demonstrate. Examples of commonly used verbs include &quot;identify,&quot; &quot;analyze,&quot; &quot;describe,&quot; &quot;compare,&quot; &quot;explain,&quot; and &quot;design.&quot;</li><li><strong>Be specific.</strong> TThe objective should clearly state what the student should be able to do after achieving teh desired learning.

Importantly, students do not necessarily have to complete LOCs before moving to HOCs. In fact, asking questions, making assessments, or proposing hypotheses can encourage a growth mindset and readiness to learn the facts or concepts. For example, sometimes it makes more sense to ask a question or propose a hypothesis before learning the content, which can also activate prior knowledge and metacognition. Including HOCs is also valuable in helping students emulate how scientists think.

This requires that we design assessments that are aligned to the learning objectives.</p><p>Why is this such a critical step? Because assessment drives learning. When students have opportunities to practice the material they are learning, they are better able to diagnose their understanding and can change their study strategies, if necessary. These strategies are effective in improving learning gains (<a href="../refs/#hartwig2012study">Hartwig and Dunlosky, 2012</a>; <a href="../refs/#sebesta2017should">Sebesta and Bray Speth, 2017</a>). Misalignment between learning objectives and assessments can negatively impact student performance (<a href="../refs/#o2010report">O&#39;Neill <em>et al.</em>, 2010</a>). This creates uncertainty for students about where to focus their study efforts, which is the opposite of an inclusive learning environment.</p><p>Imagine studying for an exam by solving problems and designing potential experiments, only to find that the exam is all memorization. A student may rightfully feel frustrated, thinking they &quot;wasted time&quot; studying the wrong material.</p><p>Now imagine the opposite scenario, where a student presumes the exam will have lower-order cognitive questions, but the exam has mostly higher-order cognitive questions. The student is unlikely to perform well and will be frustrated that the course materials did not adequately prepare them for the exam.</p><p>In both cases, the students’ study strategies are misaligned with the objectives of the exam. Instead, when students have the chance to practice the skills they are expected to learn, and those are the skills on which they are tested, it creates a less frustrating and more equitable learning environment for everyone. It also makes it easier on the instructor to interpret data from the assessment and determine whether to modify their teaching to address where students are struggling.</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Study Skills</h4><p>What might be effective ways for students to study to prepare them to:</p><blockquote><p>Label the parts of a plant cell and recall their functions, including the cell wall, nucleus, chloroplasts, and mitochondria.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Study Skills: Now You Try!</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>Above, we asked you to imagine the third week/day for your course and some learning objectives for that moment in time.</p><p>Select one of those objectives.

We will introduce key ideas related to developing activities here and then explore them in more detail in the <em>Learning Experiences</em> module.</p><p>What students practice in class and in homework should align with how they are assessed to ensure that they have an opportunity to practice and eventually demonstrate proficiency with the intended learning objectives. For example, if students had never practiced analyzing figures during class or on homework assignments, they would not be prepared to analzye graphs on an exam and the instructor could not conclude how well their curriculum advanced students&#39; ability to analyze graphs based on exam performance. In this case, their exam performance would not fairly measure what they learned in the course, instead measuring their prior knowledge and skills. </p><p>Let&#39;s look at an example of a learning objective and assessment question:</p><blockquote><p>Learning objective: Students will be able to explain the connections between the various stages of the water cycle.</p><p>Assessment question: In what ways does the stage of infiltration rely on the previous stages of the water cycle, like precipitation and surface runoff?</p></blockquote><p>What might be an appropriate activity for students to gain practice toward answering the assessment question? Some options might be:</p><ul><li>Students construct a diagram that shows each stage of the water cycle. They label each stage and explain how water moves through the cycle.</li><li>Students watch a video of someone conducting an soil absorption experiment using sand, gravel, and clay. Students discuss how much water is absorbed from the simulated precipitation and simulated runoff.</li><li>Students design an experiment to measure how much water is absorbed by different soil types.</li><li>Students compare and contrast how the water cycle varies depending on the climate, such as a tropical rainforest versus a desert.</li></ul><p>We will practice creating learning experiences, writing assessments, and scaffolding activities in the modules to follow, so hold onto the learning objective(s) you wrote!</p><h3 id="Step-4.-Check-alignment-within-curriculum-and-values."><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Step-4.-Check-alignment-within-curriculum-and-values.">Step 4.
