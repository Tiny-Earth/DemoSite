title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Summative assessments are evaluations conducted at the end of a learning period to determine a student’s overall understanding and development of expertise. As seen in the backward design process, summative assessments provide evidence about the extent to which students achieved the learning objectives (<a href="../refs/#wiggins2005understanding">Wiggins, 2005</a>; <a href="../refs/#wiggins2011understanding">Wiggins and McTighe, 2011</a>).</p><p>Unlike formative assessments, which are ongoing and provide feedback during the learning process, summative assessments are typically administered after a unit has been completed to provide a summary of a student’s learning progress and achievement (<a href="../refs/#kibble2017best">Kibble, 2017</a>). Summative assessments are comprehensive and assess a broad range of knowledge, skills, and competencies related to the learning objectives. Often, they are high-stakes, meaning formative assessments carry significant weight in determining students’ grades or academic progress.</p><p>Examples of summative assessments include:</p><ul><li>Comprehensive tests</li><li>Written artifacts</li><li>Project products</li><li>Presentations</li><li>Performance assessments</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Summative-Assessment?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Why-Summative-Assessment?">Why Summative Assessment?</a><a id="Why-Summative-Assessment?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Why-Summative-Assessment?" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Summative assessments play a role beyond merely assigning grades to students. They serve as invaluable tools for evaluating student learning and providing feedback to both learners and instructors.</p><p>For the learners, summative assessments serve as pivotal milestones in a course’s trajectory, marking significant targets for students to strive toward. Summative assessments also hold students accountable for their learning and represent indicators of their increasing expertise and competence in the subject matter as they move toward understanding. Assessment drives learning; students tend to focus on what will be assessed.</p><p>For instructors, summative assessments provide essential data to gauge the extent to which students have met predefined objectives, as well as identifying areas where additional support may be required. As a scientific instructor, collecting and analyzing this data is crucial in refining your teaching practice (<a href="../refs/#ebert2003disciplinary">Ebert-May <em>et al.</em>, 2003</a>) and is aligned with calls to teach science the same way it is practiced (AAAS, 1990; Annenberg/CPB, 1997; NRC, 1997, 1999; Bransford et al., 1999; Pellegrino et al. 2001; Cech, 2003).</p><p>Like a scientist uses data to evaluate their hypotheses, a scientific instructor uses assessment data to evaluate their instructional practice. And given the importance of engaging students in scientific practices to equip them for future careers in science, summative assessments need to extend beyond evaluation of content knowledge and assess competencies expected for aspiring scientists.</p><h2 id="A-Framework-for-Summative-Assessment"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#A-Framework-for-Summative-Assessment">A Framework for Summative Assessment</a><a id="A-Framework-for-Summative-Assessment-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#A-Framework-for-Summative-Assessment" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>You already have the framework! Recall that when we leverage backward design, we:</p><ul><li>Identify desired results about enduring understanding (learning objectives).</li><li>Articulate what evidence would indicate progress toward and achievement of understanding.</li><li>Plan learning experiences to guide students toward understanding.</li></ul><p>These pieces of evidence will be used to guide the creation of summative assessments, which will both reinforce key concepts and serve as checkpoints throughout the learning process in your STEM course.</p><h2 id="Summative-Assessment-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Summative-Assessment-in-Practice">Summative Assessment in Practice</a><a id="Summative-Assessment-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Summative-Assessment-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Summative assessments are a critical component of course design that depends on the information you are trying to gather. Different summative assessments gather different information about a student’s learning by focusing on various aspects of their knowledge, skills, and abilities.</p><p>Each strategy also varies in how broadly or deeply the objectives are assessed, its objectivity, the amount of time and resources it takes to administer and grade, and whether it adds additional performance anxiety to the student.</p><p>By using a variety of assessment methods, instructors can gain a more comprehensive understanding of a student’s strengths and areas for improvement. </p><h3 id="Summative-Assessment-Techniques"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Summative-Assessment-Techniques">Summative Assessment Techniques</a><a id="Summative-Assessment-Techniques-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Summative-Assessment-Techniques" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Reflecting on backward design, your assessments need to be aligned to the learning objectives of the unit. In a STEM course, summative assessments provide a way for students to demonstrate their understanding of the facets of science. Therefore, the summative assessment techniques chosen for your course should be informed by what skills and knowledge students need to exhibit competence according to the STEM learning objectives you set for the course.</p><p>For example, here are four different approaches to summative assessment:</p><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click for a Traditional Exam-Based Example</summary><div class="admonition-body"><ul><li>Weekly quizzes</li><li>3 midterm exams</li><li>Final exam</li></ul></div></details><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click for a Writing-Centric Example</summary><div class="admonition-body"><ul><li>Weekly short answer quizzes</li><li>4 self-reflection essays</li><li>Final research paper (scaffolded sections due every 2 weeks)</li></ul></div></details><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click for a Project-Based Example</summary><div class="admonition-body"><ul><li>Weekly quizzes</li><li>Group project: proposal, presentation, report</li><li>Individual self-reflection essay</li></ul></div></details><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click for a Performance-Based Example</summary><div class="admonition-body"><ul><li>Daily pre-lab quizzes</li><li>3 lab reports</li><li>4 lab practicals</li><li>Independent project: proposal, presentation, report</li></ul></div></details><p>Notice that all the summative assessment plans utilize more than one kind of summative assessment technique except the Traditional Exam-Based plan, which only uses tests. A well-designed plan incorporates a range of assessment opportunities that combine both low- and high-stakes assessments. For example, all of the plans administer weekly or daily quizzes instead of just a few during the whole semester. This way, lower performance on one assessment doesn’t devastate a student&#39;s grade and they have multiple opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge and abilities.</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Plan for Summative Assessment</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>In the <em>Course Design</em> module, we asked you to imagine the third week/day for your course and some objectives for that moment in time.</p><p>Then in <em>Active Learning Experiences</em>, we asked you to design an activity that embodies active learning experiences around one objective.</p><p>How could students demonstrate enduring understanding of the scientific content and concepts related to that objective? </p><p>In what ways could they demonstrate scientific skills and competencies related to that objective?</p><p>Be sure to imagine several, varied ways students could demonstrate the objective.</p></div></div><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Design with Professor Pham</h4><p>Professor Pham is designing an assessment plan for their medical microbiology course. As learning goals for the course, Professor Pham wants students to develop skills in collecting and organizing information, communication, and creative thinking, as well as understand how microorganisms impact human health and society. Professor Pham knows that presentations can be an excellent medium to assess these competencies.</p><p>How could Professor Pham design the presentation assignment to align with facets of science?</p><p>For example, to target the Discovery facet, the presentation must address potential biases and stereotypes in medical history and reflect on the importance of diversity and inclusion in microbiology research.

While these principles may seem intuitive, it’s essential to delve deeper into the evidence-based strategies instructors can use to design assessments that promote equity and accuracy. By doing so, educators can create a fair and inclusive assessment environment that values the diverse strengths and abilities of all students.</p><h3 id="Example-of-an-Inclusive-Assessment-Tool:-Rubrics"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Example-of-an-Inclusive-Assessment-Tool:-Rubrics">Example of an Inclusive Assessment Tool: Rubrics</a><a id="Example-of-an-Inclusive-Assessment-Tool:-Rubrics-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Example-of-an-Inclusive-Assessment-Tool:-Rubrics" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>To be fair and equitable, assessments need to be evaluated in a way that is standardized and consistent across student work. Rubrics can achieve this goal by providing a detailed description of the criteria and standards used to assess student performance. Rubrics help instructors assess student work systematically and consistently, providing feedback that is aligned with the established criteria. Without rubrics, written assessments can be subjective and biased, leading to unfair grading and lack of clarity for students.</p><p>Rubrics also provide a positive framework for student expectations, outlining clear steps that show progress toward meeting those goals. Conveniently, when shared with students, rubrics support metacognition by giving students the tools they need to self- or peer-assess their learning while developing their ideas and creating early drafts.</p><h3 id="Considerations-for-creating-rubrics"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Considerations-for-creating-rubrics">Considerations for creating rubrics</a><a id="Considerations-for-creating-rubrics-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Considerations-for-creating-rubrics" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>A rubric typically consists of a grid or list that outlines the specific criteria for success, along with descriptions of different levels of performance for each criterion (e.g., developing, proficient, and excellent).</p><p><strong>Rubrics can be analytic or holistic.</strong> Analytic rubrics provide a different score for each criterion, such as overall ideas and conceptual understanding, organization, use of evidence in arguments, grammar and spelling, and format. In contrast, holistic rubrics provide a single score that represents the grader’s overall assessment of the work and how its components hang together (<a href="../refs/#bean2021engaging">Bean and Melzer, 2021</a>). Analytic rubrics are more common in STEM courses, though holistic rubrics are not unheard of.</p><p><strong>Rubrics can be generic or task-specific.</strong> A generic rubric would apply to multiple assignments, whereas a task-specific rubric would call out specific criteria for one assignment (<a href="../refs/#bean2021engaging">Bean and Melzer, 2021</a>). For example, a generic rubric could be used to assess all written assignments during a semester, whereas a task-specific rubric would be tailored for each lab report.</p><p><strong>Rubrics use a range of descriptors for performance levels</strong> (<a href="../refs/#bean2021engaging">Bean and Melzer, 2021</a>). Terms indicating understanding or achievement of learning objectives might include “exceeds”, “fully”, or “meets criteria”. Terms such as “usually” and “sometimes” specify mid-range competency and may indicate that students need more practice with the concepts or skills, or that they need to improve communication of their understanding. Terms like “never”, “rarely”, or “minimally” convey that the criteria are not being met and more work would need to be done to further understanding or demonstrate proficiency.</p><p>And to write a rubric, once again we revisit our backward design principles:</p><ul><li>Establish clear and specific expectations for student performance based on the assignment type (e.g., written lab report, oral presentation).</li><li>Use the expectations to fill out the “criteria” column of the rubric, then articulate “rating” levels.</li><li>Confirm that the rubric is emphasizing knowledge and skills gained in the course, rather than prior knowledge or ability.</li></ul><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Analytic vs. Holistic Rubric</h4><p>Examine <a href="../assets/paper-rubrics.html">these example rubrics</a> showing two difference approaches to assessing STEM student work.</p><p>Which example rubric resonates with your experiences as a student?

Time-limited tests are less valid, reliable, inclusive, and equitable than tests in which there is no time limit or a time limit that’s so generous that all students can complete all items (<a href="../refs/#gernsbacher2020four">Gernsbacher <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a>).</p><p>Test-taking pace is not a valid measure of student understanding. Students who need additional test-taking times are literally excluded from the test-taking classroom. Timed tests restrict students who have anxiety, are learning English, from underrepresented backgrounds, older than average, and students with disabilities who face barriers obtaining accommodations.</p><p>Research shows that most students who do receive additional time on tests do not use all of it (<a href="../refs/#cahalan2006observational">Cahalan-Laitusis <em>et al.</em>, 2006</a>; <a href="../refs/#holmes2019extra">Holmes and Silvestri, 2019</a>; <a href="../refs/#spenceley2016use">Spenceley and Wheeler, 2016</a>). Gernsbacher speculates that these students are actually requesting to not experience the anxiety and pressure of running out of time (<a href="../refs/#gernsbacher2020four">Gernsbacher <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a>). When time limits are removed from exams, numerous studies have shown that student performance improves across student groups including those who are learning English, from underrepresented backgrounds, older than average, and females (<a href="../refs/#de2016performs">De Paola and Gioia, 2016</a>; <a href="../refs/#foos2008adult">Foos and Boone, 2008</a>; <a href="../refs/#mullane2000effects">Mullane and McKelvie, 2000</a>). For example, Foos and Boone showed that young adults score higher than older adults under standard timed test conditions, but older adults perform as well as young adults when time limits are removed (<a href="../refs/#foos2008adult">Foos and Boone, 2008</a>).</p><p>So, consider administering untimed asynchronous tests such as take-home exams or untimed online exams, or design test questions that aren’t easily searchable by leveraging higher-order skills and the facets of science.</p><h3 id="Equitable-Summative-Assessments-Leverage-Universal-Design-for-Learning"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Equitable-Summative-Assessments-Leverage-Universal-Design-for-Learning">Equitable Summative Assessments Leverage Universal Design for Learning</a><a id="Equitable-Summative-Assessments-Leverage-Universal-Design-for-Learning-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Equitable-Summative-Assessments-Leverage-Universal-Design-for-Learning" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>As we saw in the Course Design module, incorporating Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles into course materials not only benefits students with disabilities but also enhances learning experiences for all learners. In addition, instructors have a responsibility to comply with disability rights legislation and provide student accommodations to ensure access to educational materials and assessments. Here are suggestions for how you can use UDL principles in the context of summative assessments:</p><p><strong>Provide multiple means of representation</strong> by offering different formats for presenting information:</p><ul><li>Visual: images, diagrams, charts, and graphs</li><li>Auditory: audio recordings, podcasts, and videos</li><li>Text-based: written text, transcripts, and summaries</li></ul><p><strong>Provide multiple means of action and expression</strong> to allow students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills through various methods:</p><ul><li>Writing: papers (research, essay, lab reports) and free-response answers</li><li>Speaking: oral presentations, debates, and discussions</li><li>Creating: multimedia projects</li></ul><p><strong>Provide multiple means of engagement</strong> by incorporating features that motivate and engage students:</p><ul><li>Authentic tasks: use real-world problems that reflect students’ interests and experiences</li><li>Cultural relevance: incorporate diverse perspectives, cultures, examples, and scenarios</li><li>Choice and autonomy: allow students to choose topics, formats, or pace</li><li>Provide regular feedback and progress monitoring</li></ul><h3 id="Equitable-Summative-Assessments-Reduce-Stereotype-Threat"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Equitable-Summative-Assessments-Reduce-Stereotype-Threat">Equitable Summative Assessments Reduce Stereotype Threat</a><a id="Equitable-Summative-Assessments-Reduce-Stereotype-Threat-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Equitable-Summative-Assessments-Reduce-Stereotype-Threat" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>As we saw in the <em>Inclusive Learning</em> module, stereotype threat is a psychological phenomenon that refers to the feeling of anxiety or self-doubt that individuals experience when they are in a situation where they are at risk of being judged or evaluated based on a negative stereotype about their group (<a href="../refs/#Steele2002-pt">Steele <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>). This can lead to a decrease in performance and motivation, as individuals may feel like they are being held to a lower standard or that they are being judged based on their group membership rather than their individual abilities.</p><p>Students deserve the opportunity to engage with an assessment to the best of their ability without being impeded by stereotype threats, biases, or assumptions. To achieve this, it is therefore crucial that summative assessments are designed and conducted in a way that minimizes the activation of stereotype threat by following these practices:</p><ul><li>Frame assessments as opportunities to learn and demonstrate progress rather than as high-stakes evaluations. Do not frame exams or quizzes as definitive judgments of a student&#39;s intelligence or identity.</li><li>Provide practice exams, assignments, or low-stakes quizzes to help students become familiar with the testing format and reduce anxiety.</li><li>Teach stress-reduction techniques, such as deep breathing or mindfulness exercises, before exams.</li><li>Write inclusive test questions, and include diverse and inclusive examples and scenarios.</li><li>Ensure that test materials, such as images or scenarios, do not perpetuate negative stereotypes or biases.</li><li>Solicit demographic information after exams, not before (<a href="../refs/#Kumar2010-mp">Kumar, Oct 2010</a>).</li></ul><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Commit to Action: Equitable Summative Assessments</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>What is one concrete action you can take to make the design of your summative assessments more equitable?</p></div></div><h3 id="Equitable-Grading"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Equitable-Grading">Equitable Grading</a><a id="Equitable-Grading-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Equitable-Grading" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Traditional grading is the practice of assigning numerical points to one-time assessments and aggregating those points into a single letter grade for the course (Clark &amp; Talbert, 2023). Often, there are no opportunities to reattempt the assessment, so students are unable to apply feedback (Clark &amp; Talbert, 2023). Overall, traditional grading penalizes students who have received unequal opportunities and discourages growth and learning (Clark &amp; Talbert, 2023).</p><p>Incorporating more equitable grading practices promotes a more just and inclusive educational environment that supports the success of all students. Below are some equitable grading practices you can implement in your course.</p><p>In providing feedback (<a href="../refs/#hope2020only">Hope, 2020</a>):</p><ul><li>Ensure it is constructive, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement. Specific and actionable feedback can help students understand their performance and make meaningful progress towards developing expertise</li><li>Locate it separately from the grade or points</li><li>Make sure it is timely so that students are not waiting or guessing</li></ul><p>Ensure your grading policy is transparent (<a href="../refs/#garcia2023equitable">Garcia <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>):</p><ul><li>Communicate the criteria and standards used to evaluate performance</li><li>Communicate how grades are assigned</li><li>Provide rubrics, standards, or expectations</li></ul><p>Do not apply grading curves (Feldman, 2019):</p><ul><li>Curves are not transparent and make it difficult for students to determine grades</li><li>They are inconsistent and unfair</li><li>Curving grades is the result of misalignment in the course design: instructors need to ask themselves why students are failing exams rather than applying a curve (which “fixes” the symptom but not the underlying issue)</li></ul><p>Check your own biases and assumptions (Feldman, 2019):</p><ul><li>Confirmation bias: don’t let existing beliefs about a student bias your grading.</li><li>Halo effect: don’t let a first impression of a student bias your grading.</li><li>Become aware of common stereotypes and find ways to avoid perpetuating and activating them.</li><li>Don’t let expectations or assumptions about students affect your grading.</li><li>Use your grading data to self-check: did you give males higher scores over females on free-response questions? What about students from HECs?</li></ul><p>Provide opportunities for practice, retakes, and redos (Feldman, 2019):</p><ul><li>Allow students to apply what they learned from the assessment feedback to retest for partial or full credit.</li><li>Assessment drives learning: give students another opportunity to grow and showcase their knowledge.</li><li>Provide lots of opportunities for students to practice with the material and get feedback before the high-stakes assessment.</li></ul><h3 id="Alternative-Grading-Methods"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Alternative-Grading-Methods">Alternative Grading Methods</a><a id="Alternative-Grading-Methods-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Alternative-Grading-Methods" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>In recent years, there has been a growing movement to move away from traditional grading methods altogether and implement alternative grading methods. Alternative grading shifts the focus from traditional letter grades (A-F) or numerical scores to a more nuanced and detailed assessment of student learning.</p><p>Common alternative grading methods include standards-based grading, specifications grading, and ungrading. Briefly:</p><ul><li>Standards-based grading assesses students’ competency of specific skills or knowledge: final grades are based on how many standards a student meets, no matter the number of attempts (Clark &amp; Talbert, 2023).</li><li>In specifications or specs grading, the instructor creates a list of attributes of a successful submission for assignments. Students then earn a “Satisfactory” or “Not Yet” on their work and have the opportunity to resubmit for full credit (Clark &amp; Talbert, 2023).</li><li>Ungrading removes grades in favor of formative and descriptive feedback. It can replace deficit thinking with an approach that values students’ cultural and familial knowledge, recognizing these insights as critical to their education and relationships (Mejia 2018). Instructors meet regularly with students to discuss progress, and students build a portfolio of their work and growth (Clark &amp; Talbert, 2023).</li></ul><p>Instructors who are interested in alternative grading but can’t or aren’t ready to overhaul their course can try partial conversions, such as standards-based testing (i.e., only tests are graded using standards).</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Commit to Action: Equitable Grading</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>What is one concrete action you can take to make the grading in your course more equitable?</p></div></div><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>Reflection: Course Alignment</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>Briefly describe the alignment between your summative assessment plan and your inclusive learning commitments, learning objectives, and syllabus.
