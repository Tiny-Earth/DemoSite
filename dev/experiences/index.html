Active teaching strategies have students do something other than take notes or follow directions, placing the responsibility for learning squarely on their shoulders. As they participate in activities that involve group learning, problem solving, or inquiry-based learning, students construct new knowledge and build new scientific skills.” (Handelsman et al., 2007) </li><li>“Active learning engages students in the process of learning through activities and/or discussions in class, as opposed to passively listening to an expert.” (Freeman et al. 2014)</li></ul></div></details><p>How were the published definitions similar to or different from your definition?</p><p>Were the differences surprising or enlightening?</p><p>Rethink your working definition of active learning to include any new insights or nuances that you have gained.</p></div></div><p>While active learning is a broad concept that encompasses a variety of techniques, a common feature of any definition is that students are cognitively engaged in something.

</figure><p>Each of the four modes is defined by the level of cognitive demand and type of learning activity. Additionally, the ICAP framework suggests that higher levels of engagement (constructive and interactive) lead to better learning outcomes than lower levels (passive and active) because they involve more complex cognitive processing.</p><p>In scientific teaching, we use the term <strong>“active learning experiences”</strong> as an umbrella term that encompasses active, interactive, and constructive modes of engagement, in contrasts to passive modes of engagement.</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>ICAP Matching</h4><p>Match each of the following activity descriptions with the appropriate ICAP category: interactive, constructive, active, or passive.</p><ul><li>Completing worksheets, solving problems, or participating in discussions</li><li>Group discussions, collaborative projects, or peer teaching</li><li>Listening to lectures, watching demonstrations, or reading instructional materials</li><li>Generating explanations, creating concept maps, or engaging in problem-solving tasks</li></ul></div></div><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>TODO title</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>Based on the above descriptions of the ICAP modes of engagement, which modes do you currently use most often in your course?

For example, formative assessment can take place during discussions of different ideas during a group activity, or when students answer a polling question, discuss their answers, and then explain their reasoning back to the whole class. In contrast, <strong>summative assessment</strong> involves the evaluations done at the end of a learning experience, such as an exam or lab report. We will discuss summative assessments separately in the <em>Summative Assessment</em> module.</p><p>Formative assessment builds on active learning and connects directly to learning principles: as students apply new knowledge and practice new skills, they have the opportunity to think critically about their progress toward understanding and competency. In other words, formative assessment encourages students to think metacognitively.</p><p>Formative assessment provides a unique opportunity for feedback, which can take various forms. This may include self-assessment using a rubric, peer review with guidelines for constructive feedback, or instructor-led commentary. Importantly, formative assessment is often not tied to performance, which allows students to focus on the process of learning rather than whether their answer is correct.</p><p><strong>The relationship between active learning and formative assessment is nearly inseparable.</strong> The act of performing a task provides feedback to the individual, enabling them to gauge their progress.</p><p>For example, when asked to interpret a graph as part of a learning activity, students reveal to themselves their ability to extract and analyze information, allowing them to make real-time adjustments to their study approaches. Likewise, active learning provides feedback to the instructor about how students are progressing toward the learning objectives, thereby providing useful data about where course corrections or additional information could better support students.</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>TODO Activity title</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>How does your course use formative assessment?

For example, a seminal metastudy by Freeman and colleagues (2014) synthesized the findings of over 200 active-learning studies in STEM and found that students in active courses consistently performed half a standard deviation higher than those in passive classes. Likewise, a survey of nearly 1,000 students who experienced active learning more often reported higher learning gains and improvements in collaborative skills. (Reeves et al., 2024). Another study found that polling questions that challenged students to think critically and solve problems collaboratively led to improved learning gains—and more questions correlated with higher gains (Smith et al., 2009, 2011).</p><p>Failure rates also illuminate a stark contrast between courses taught with an active vs. traditional  (passive) approach. In a meta-analysis of 200 published papers comparing student outcomes in matched courses, Freeman et al. (2014) found that students in active STEM courses had a 10% lower failure rate than those in passive courses.</p><p><strong>Active learning is an equitable practice.</strong> The positive benefits of active learning disproportionately affect STEM students from historically excluded groups, closing the gap between majority and minority students. A meta-analysis of 41 published papers showed that active courses led to a 33% reduction in exam score gaps between majority and minority students, and a 45% reduction in the gap for failure rates (Theobald et al., 2020).</p><p><strong>Active learning leverages how learning works.</strong> Active learning taps into metacognition, which engages students in reflecting on their learning and encouraging them to adjust their approach if needed. Active learning helps students connect new information to their existing knowledge and experiences, making it more meaningful and memorable. It fosters a growth mindset and makes space to evaluate options and make informed decisions. [TODO refs]</p><p><strong>Active learning models the facets of science.</strong> Active learning allows for opportunities to practice the facets of science, making space to troubleshoot, evaluate options, and make informed decisions based on evidence and data. Activities that reflect scientific ways of thinking fit well into active learning formats, such as generating hypotheses, designing experiments, and analyzing data (Evans et al., 2021; Hanauer et al., 2017; Jordan et al., 2014; Lopatto et al., 2008; Olson et al., 2019; Shaffer et al., 2014; Waddell et al., 2021).</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>TODO Activity title</h4><p>The literature on active learning argues that its implementation leads to improved learning gains, lower failure rates, and reduced achievement gaps.</p><p>Reflect on the following three arguments.

They also leverage the facets of science and how learning works.</p><p>Let’s look at a detailed example of how a common instructional strategy can leverage the learning experiences framework: think-pair-share. Then, you will think through a different instructional strategy in a similar way on your own.</p><h3 id="Example-of-an-Active-Learning-Experience:-Think-Pair-Share"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Example-of-an-Active-Learning-Experience:-Think-Pair-Share">Example of an Active Learning Experience: Think-Pair-Share</a><a id="Example-of-an-Active-Learning-Experience:-Think-Pair-Share-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Example-of-an-Active-Learning-Experience:-Think-Pair-Share" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Think-pair-share is a flexible activity that can be adapted to almost any teaching situation. It has three steps:</p><ol><li>Students think (or write) individually in response to a problem or question,</li><li>discuss their ideas and answers in pairs, and then</li><li>share (or write) their answers with the rest of the class or the instructor.</li></ol><h3 id="How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-encompass-active-learning?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-encompass-active-learning?">How does a Think-Pair-Share encompass active learning?</a><a id="How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-encompass-active-learning?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-encompass-active-learning?" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>A think-pair-share is an active-learning strategy because students are actively engaged in various cognitive processes and collaborative learning. It also maps onto how learning works:</p><ul><li><strong>Activate prior knowledge:</strong> During the “think” phase, students reflect on their prior knowledge and experiences. This activates their existing knowledge and helps them to make connections to what they already know. Even if their prior knowledge is incomplete or inaccurate, students can identify and question their own understanding.</li><li><strong>Recognize dissonance:</strong> As students share their thoughts with their partner, they may encounter conflicting ideas that challenge their existing understanding. Peer-to-peer dialogue allows students to discuss and reconcile any differences in their understanding.</li><li><strong>Construct new knowledge:</strong> Throughout the think-pair-share activity, students are integrating new information with their existing knowledge, forming new connections between ideas, and developing a deeper understanding of the topic. Knowledge construction is reinforced through the social interaction and feedback provided by their partner.</li><li><strong>Practice and apply knowledge:</strong> Throughout the think-pair-share activity, students are sharing their thoughts and ideas, engaging in a collaborative conversation, receiving feedback, and responding to questions.</li></ul><h3 id="How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-leverage-formative-assessment?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-leverage-formative-assessment?">How does a Think-Pair-Share leverage formative assessment?</a><a id="How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-leverage-formative-assessment?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-leverage-formative-assessment?" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The first step (thinking) gives students time to evaluate their understanding of the topic and therefore requires them to be metacognitive: What do I already know? How do the pieces fit together?</p><p>The later steps (pairing and sharing) require students to compare and contrast their ideas with other students’ and evaluate whether they need to adjust their ideas to be more complete or accurate.</p><p>From the instructor perspective, consider how think-pair-share acts as a window into the students’ thinking that helps you understand whether they understand the material. The student responses, performance, and engagement become valuable indicators for assessing progress toward the learning objectives.</p><h3 id="How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-foster-inclusive-learning?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-foster-inclusive-learning?">How does a Think-Pair-Share foster inclusive learning?</a><a id="How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-foster-inclusive-learning?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-foster-inclusive-learning?" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The structure of a think-pair-share ticks several inclusive learning boxes. Because everyone processes information at different speeds, posing a problem as a think-pair-share allows students the necessary time to reflect, formulate their thoughts, and even write out their answers. Moreover, sharing with the whole class can be overwhelming for some students. With a partner, they practice explaining their thinking, which prepares them for sharing responses with the class. And the best part? Everyone’s voice gets heard (even if only in a pair), and everyone hears different perspectives.</p><p>A think-pair-share also fosters a growth mindset. It breaks down complicated processes into bite-sized, achievable steps, providing time to practice new skills and work with new information. It allows for mistakes and misconceptions to emerge, with time to safely deliberate and decide whether to adjust ideas or tactics.</p><h3 id="A-few-tips-to-make-a-think-pair-share-more-just-and-equitable"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#A-few-tips-to-make-a-think-pair-share-more-just-and-equitable">A few tips to make a think-pair-share more just and equitable</a><a id="A-few-tips-to-make-a-think-pair-share-more-just-and-equitable-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#A-few-tips-to-make-a-think-pair-share-more-just-and-equitable" title="Permalink"></a></h3><ul><li>Invite students to share in a way that makes it clear you’re opening up the conversation, rather than looking for a particular answer on the first try (Waugh and Andrews, 2020). For example, ask, “Can you get us started with an answer?”</li><li>Survey the class early in the term to find out who is willing to share their thoughts with the class and who prefers not to (Cooper et al. 2021).</li><li>Randomize the list of students to call on to prevent biasing responses to those who are fast at processing information or confident speaking in large groups—and to whom other students may defer even if they are incorrect (Theobald et al. 2017).</li></ul><h3 id="How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-encourage-scientific-thinking?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-encourage-scientific-thinking?">How does a Think-Pair-Share encourage scientific thinking?</a><a id="How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-encourage-scientific-thinking?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#How-does-a-Think-Pair-Share-encourage-scientific-thinking?" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>A think-pair-share activity can break down the facets of science into smaller parts, giving students the opportunity to practice various important skills in their STEM discipline. For example, in a math or computer science class, students might practice summarizing data, debug a few lines of data, or apply mathematical formulas. In a chemistry course, they might examine the limitations of data, select appropriate reagents for an experiment, or troubleshoot experimental hurdles. In an engineering course, students could determine what information is relevant and propose which computer program or device could solve the problem. In a biology class, they might critique experimental designs, identify appropriate controls and treatments, draw conclusions based on evidence, or ask questions about the natural world, public health, or whatever content is relevant to that course.</p><h3 id="What-are-considerations-for-designing-a-Think-Pair-Share?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What-are-considerations-for-designing-a-Think-Pair-Share?">What are considerations for designing a Think-Pair-Share?</a><a id="What-are-considerations-for-designing-a-Think-Pair-Share?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What-are-considerations-for-designing-a-Think-Pair-Share?" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Creating a Think-Pair-Share requires thinking like a designer, so leverage backward design and start with learning objectives. Then move on to design considerations about inclusion, accessibility, and the practicalities of classroom management, such as:</p><ul><li>Does every student need to share their response, or will a few sample responses be sufficient?</li><li>When will the sharing happen? Immediately following the think-pair? At the end of class? After class?</li><li>How will the sharing happen? Verbally in class? Through an electronic polling or learning management system that collects and displays responses instantaneously? On the learning management system discussion board? Through a written “exit ticket” or “one-minute essay”? (Note: Index cards are great for these.)</li><li>Will there be a follow up activity after the share-out? For example, if the class was split on the response to the original prompt, what additional information or hints could be provided for a second think-pair-share? Would the prompt be the same, or would it change?</li><li>Will they be graded? If so, on participation, content, creativity, or something else?</li><li>If students express misconceptions or inaccurate information, how will that be addressed?</li></ul><p>How you make these design decisions will depend on your own design context and commitments. However, pausing to consider the design decisions that will accompany all your learning experiences will help you to more intentionally design active learning experiences.</p><h3 id="Beyond-Think-Pair-Share"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Beyond-Think-Pair-Share">Beyond Think-Pair-Share</a><a id="Beyond-Think-Pair-Share-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Beyond-Think-Pair-Share" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Review the following list of active learning strategies, which has been compiled from multiple sources (Tanner 2013, [TODO other refs]. Consider how each technique actively engages students, provides feedback to themselves and others, and could be used in your classroom.</p><ul><li><strong>Case-based learning:</strong> Students solve an open-ended, real-world situation that requires critical thinking and problem-solving. They make decisions based on the case description and their prior knowledge, thinking beyond the context of the case and consider the broader impacts of their decisions.</li><li><strong>Concept mapping:</strong> Starting with a central idea or concept, students generate related ideas, words, and phrases. They use arrows with short descriptions to connect concepts and create a visual web of relationships, then explain it to each other or the instructor.</li><li><strong>Decision making:</strong> Students take on the role as policy-makers and are presented with a scenario or problem. They must gather information, think critically about their options, and develop a creative solution.</li><li><strong>Discussion forums:</strong> Students participate in an online discussion forum/board on their learning management platform. Students take turns posing questions and responding to posts.</li><li><strong>Electronic audience response systems:</strong> Students respond to questions or polls using a “clicker” or their personal devices. Results are displayed in real-time, which allows students to see their peers’ answers, discuss, or reflect.</li><li><strong>Exit tickets:</strong> Students submit something before leaving class, such as work from an in-class activity like drawings, concept maps, or written responses from a think-pair-share.</li><li><strong>Group problem solving:</strong> In pairs or small groups, students solve a problem or scenario. Each group then shares their findings with the class.</li><li><strong>Jigsaw:</strong> Each group of students works on a particular topic (a “puzzle piece”) that is different from all the other groups. Each group member becomes an “expert” on their topic. Students are then re-distributed into new groups in which each expert shares their knowledge with other group members, completing a “jigsaw puzzle.”</li><li><strong>Muddiest Point:</strong> This version of an “exit ticket” that asks students to write one question they have or to list a point they still don’t understand.</li><li><strong>One-minute writes:</strong> With one minute to respond, students reflect, think critically, or brainstorm in response to a question or prompt. These can be collected as “exit tickets.”</li><li><strong>Problem-based learning:</strong> Students address a complex and real-life question that has a specific goal. They work in teams to assess the problem, research more information, and devise a solution.</li><li><strong>Quizzes:</strong> Students complete short, frequent assessments that can gauge prior knowledge, preparedness for class, or understanding of the week’s lessons.</li><li><strong>Random call:</strong> Students are randomly selected to participate in activities, answer questions, or share their thoughts. This can be done in various ways: create a roster that lists students’ names in a random order, pick names from a bucket, distribute tokens such as playing cards and randomly draw cards. Note: Pairing this with a think-pair-share can make this activity more equitable and just.</li><li><strong>Self-reflection/journaling:</strong> Students keep a journal of their learning to reflect on their progress, noting what they’ve understood and what they need to improve.</li><li><strong>Strip sequence:</strong> Students receive the steps (written, pictorially, or both) to a process on strips of paper that are jumbled. Then have students put the strips in chronological order.</li></ul><p>Any active learning technique can serve as a formative assessment for students, even ones that do not explicitly involve sharing with an instructor. Techniques that involve self-reflection, self-testing, or problem-solving with peers have value to student learning even if their products are not seen by an instructor or graded.</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header"></header><div class="admonition-body"><h4>TODO title</h4><p><em>Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.</em></p><p>Select one of the active learning strategies listed above.</p><p>How could the chosen strategy help students activate prior knowledge, recognize dissonance, construct new knowledge, and practice and apply knowledge in your course?</p><p>How could the chosen strategy provide formative assessments in your course, from both the student and instructor perspectives?</p><p>What limitations might the chosen strategy have for inclusivity and equity in your course?
