in learning science plus the factors that influence those opportunities. They leverage what we know about how learning works to appropriately scaffold learning.</p><p>Learning experiences manifest curricular intentions and bring science to life. They feature all the activities—active learning plus assessment opportunities—that occur during a course, plus the inclusive learning considerations that support them: from assignments to assessments, experiments to exams, interactions to inquiries, questions to quizzes. They include activities during a prescribed classroom period (such as a lecture or lab/field) and outside the classroom (such as a pre-class reading/quiz in a learning management system or a post-class homework assignment).</p><p>In the previous modules, we discussed how to account for our identities and our students’ prior knowledge, leverage the learning sciences, create a scientific curriculum with summative assessments, and design a climate that fosters learning. This module is where the action happens and the science comes to life!</p><p>We will build on the frameworks you saw previously (the 6 facets of science, the 5 dimensions of teaching, and the 5 steps in learning), by adding some new pedagogical tools: active learning strategies, formative assessment techniques, and inclusive learning approaches.</p><p>In short: Learning experiences manifest curricular intentions and bring science to life. <strong>Learning experiences = active learning + assessment + inclusive learning</strong></p><h3 id="Active-Learning-Defined"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Active-Learning-Defined">Active Learning Defined</a><a id="Active-Learning-Defined-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Active-Learning-Defined" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>At their core, learning experiences involve active learning. However, given its long history, there is not a single, consistently used definition of active learning in education literature.</p><p>So, before we delve into the whys and hows of adopting an active learning approach, let’s start by developing your personal working definition of this concept: What does active learning mean to you?</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header">Activity</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>How do you define active learning? Write this down before revealing published examples below.</p><details class="admonition is-details"><summary class="admonition-header">Click to show published examples</summary><div class="admonition-body"><ul><li>“...instructional activities involving students in doing things and thinking about what they are doing.” (Bonwell &amp; Eison, 1991)</li><li>“Active learning simply means getting involved with the information presented - really thinking about it (analyzing, synthesizing, evaluating) rather than just passively receiving it and memorizing it.” (King, 1993)</li><li>“Active learning implies that students are engaged in their own learning. Active teaching strategies have students do something other than take notes or follow directions, placing the responsibility for learning squarely on their shoulders. As they participate in activities that involve group learning, problem solving, or inquiry-based learning, students construct new knowledge and build new scientific skills.” (Handelsman et al., 2007) </li><li>“Active learning engages students in the process of learning through activities and/or discussions in class, as opposed to passively listening to an expert.” (Freeman et al. 2014)</li></ul></div></details><p>How were the published definitions similar to or different from your definition?</p><p>Were the differences surprising or enlightening?</p><p>Rethink your working definition of active learning to include any new insights or nuances that you have gained.</p></div></div><h3 id="Active-learning-assessment"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Active-learning-assessment">Active learning + assessment</a><a id="Active-learning-assessment-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Active-learning-assessment" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>One goal of the previous reflection activity was to highlight that while active learning is a broad concept that encompasses a variety of techniques, a common feature of any definition is that students are cognitively engaged in something. “It may be quietly thinking, discussing an idea in a group, conducting an experiment, solving a problem, or writing a question or idea.” (Handelsman et al., 2007). The key is to engage students so that they are constructing knowledge.</p><p>This engagement highlights where active learning converges with assessment. The act of performing a task provides feedback to the individual, enabling them to gauge their progress and adjust their approach accordingly.</p><p>For example, when asked to interpret a graph as part of a learning activity, students reveal to themselves and their instructors their ability to extract and analyze information, allowing students to make real-time adjustments. Likewise, “assessment is automatically active because the students must do something to assess themselves or be assessed” (Handelsman et al., 2007).</p><p>As such, the relationship between active learning and assessment is nearly inseparable. This is particularly true for formative assessment which occurs during the learning cycle and enables continuous improvement through feedback.</p><h3 id="Formative-Assessment-Defined"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Formative-Assessment-Defined">Formative Assessment Defined</a><a id="Formative-Assessment-Defined-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Formative-Assessment-Defined" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Ongoing feedback is one of the most reliable ways to foster learning gains (Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998). Formative assessment is defined as the suite of ongoing activities that enable students and instructors to monitor progress toward learning objectives, providing a mechanism for continuous improvement.</p><p>Formative assessment builds on active learning and connects directly to learning principles: as students apply new knowledge and practice new skills, they have the opportunity to think critically about their progress toward understanding and competency. In other words, formative assessment encourages students to think metacognitively.</p><p>Formative assessment provides a unique opportunity for feedback, which can take various forms. This may include self-assessment using a rubric, peer review with guidelines for constructive feedback, or instructor-led commentary. Importantly, formative assessment is not necessarily tied to grading, allowing students to focus on the process of learning rather than simply the outcome.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header">Activity</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Where does your current course use formative assessment?</p></div></div><h2 id="Why-Learning-Experiences"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Why-Learning-Experiences">Why Learning Experiences</a><a id="Why-Learning-Experiences-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Why-Learning-Experiences" title="Permalink"></a></h2><div class="admonition is-compat"><header class="admonition-header">Objectives</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><ul><li>Describe the outcomes of studies comparing student learning in traditional vs. active learning classrooms.</li><li>Describe the four modes of student engagement (interactive, constructive, active, and passive strategies).</li><li>Understand key concepts and principles:<ul><li>Active learning approaches lead to improved student learning and persistence, as well as increased learning gains and collaborative skills.</li><li>The more students are challenged to engage in high-level cognitive activities, the more they understand and improve.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div><h2 id="A-Framework-for-Learning-Experiences"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#A-Framework-for-Learning-Experiences">A Framework for Learning Experiences</a><a id="A-Framework-for-Learning-Experiences-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#A-Framework-for-Learning-Experiences" title="Permalink"></a></h2><div class="admonition is-compat"><header class="admonition-header">Objectives</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><ul><li>Identify the components of the learning experiences framework.</li><li>Understand key concepts and principles:<ul><li>Intentionally design learning experiences that include active learning, formative assessment, and inclusive learning.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div><h2 id="Learning-Experiences-in-Practice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Learning-Experiences-in-Practice">Learning Experiences in Practice</a><a id="Learning-Experiences-in-Practice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Learning-Experiences-in-Practice" title="Permalink"></a></h2><div class="admonition is-compat"><header class="admonition-header">Objectives</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><ul><li>List evidence-based instructional strategies that are applicable to teaching science and align with AJEDI principles.</li><li>Evaluate different types of learning experience strategies for the context of your course.</li><li>Understand key concepts and principles:<ul><li><code>TODO</code></li></ul></li></ul></div></div><h2 id="An-AJEDI-Lexicon-for-Learning-Experiences"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#An-AJEDI-Lexicon-for-Learning-Experiences">An AJEDI Lexicon for Learning Experiences</a><a id="An-AJEDI-Lexicon-for-Learning-Experiences-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#An-AJEDI-Lexicon-for-Learning-Experiences" title="Permalink"></a></h2><div class="admonition is-compat"><header class="admonition-header">Objectives</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><ul><li><code>TODO</code></li><li>Understand key concepts and principles:<ul><li><code>TODO</code></li></ul></li></ul></div></div><p><code>TODO are we including this section?</code></p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../design/">« Course Design</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../summative/">Summative Assessment »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">© 2024 The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.5.0 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Tuesday 2 July 2024 13:59">Tuesday 2 July 2024</span>.
