## Learning Objectives

!!! compat "" 
    By the end of this module, you will be able to...

    - Justify why inclusive learning matters for increasing diversity in STEM.
    - Explain how instructors, students, curriculum, and pedagogy can influence course climate.
    - Practice applying the five dimensions of inclusive teaching to your course.

## Inclusive Learning Defined
Inclusive learning refers to all the factors that contribute to a classroom environment where:

- Students feel a sense of belonging, value, and respect.
- They are provided with the necessary resources and opportunities to learn.

The curriculum, pedagogy, instructors, and students work together to create a course climate that includes and supports students in learning.

There is no shortage of inclusive teaching methods. In fact, the number of choices can be overwhelming. This module distills evidence-based practices that support an inclusive course climate and gives you the chance to evaluate them for your course. It also asks you to consider how your identities and actions influence who feels included or excluded in your course. The examples provided in this module are not comprehensive; many more can be found throughout this Scientific Teaching Course. 

## Why Inclusive Learning?

Diversity in STEM requires inclusive learning environments. Recall from the previous module that a prevailing reason students leave science majors is not because they are incapable, but because science is too often taught in a way that doesn’t inspire them or instill a sense of belonging. Consequently, more than half of the 600,000 US students who declare STEM majors change to a different major before graduating [thiry_talking_2019](@cite), with students from underrepresented backgrounds switching out of STEM at disproportionate rates [riegle2019does](@cite).

Reversing STEM attrition requires us to reimagine how the various components of a classroom work together to create inclusive learning environments.

## A Framework for Inclusive Learning

The Five Dimensions of Inclusive Teaching [bell2016design](@cite) provides a framework for understanding how instructors, students, curriculum, and pedagogy collectively influence our teaching, students’ learning, and the classroom environment.

At the center of the framework is course climate, which encompasses the atmosphere and environment in which students learn. It is influenced by the other four dimensions: instructors (who we are), students (who we teach), curriculum (what we teach), and pedagogy (how we teach).

    #### Reflection: Five Dimensions of Inclusive Teaching

    *Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.*

    What is your understanding of the term “climate dimension”? 

    Which dimension(s) may require more attention for you to consider?

### The Climate Dimension

Course climate encompasses the intellectual, social, emotional, and physical environment in a class (Ambrose et al., 2010). It is shaped by a combination of instructor decisions,  student interactions, and broader influences. As instructors, we play a key role in shaping this climate by designing and sustaining learning experiences to be welcoming and inclusive (Dewsbury & Brame, 2019; Bell et al., 2016). An inclusive course climate ensures that all students, regardless of background or identity, feel valued and supposed in their learning (Brame, 2019). As instructors, our role is to examine how we set up and sustain an inclusive course climate (Dewsbury & Brame, 2019; Bell et al., 2016).  

### The Instructor Dimension

Even though we are scientists, we are human and therefore not objective. As instructors, our identities are influenced by our values, principles, families, scientific disciplines, privileges, struggles, and all the factors that we experience during our lives (Rus et al., 2013; Peterson et al., 1999). Those influences also give us biases that lead to assumptions. 

In aggregate, our identities, biases, and assumptions affect the pedagogical choices we make regarding the content and examples we highlight, as well as the values and skills we expect our students to learn. As a result, the instructor shapes the course climate and therefore each student's learning experience. 

### The Student Dimension

Like instructors, students come to our courses with a composite of many identities and biases. Students interact with their instructors, with each other, and with  content in the context of a course’s climate. Students’ identities and their interactions influence the extent to which they feel a sense of belonging, which affects learning outcomes and persistence in STEM. 

#### The Connection between Identity and Belonging

The Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influence (TIMSI) explains the psychological mechanisms underlying belonging in STEM [estrada2011toward](@cite). The TIMSI describes three orientations that contribute to student persistence in STEM:

- **Scientific self-efficacy:** Students feel capable of performing the actions needed to be successful in science.
- **Scientific identity:** Students perceive science as part of who they are and feel a sense of belonging within a scientific community.
- **Scientific values:** Students authentically agree with the values of the scientific community, such as the importance of rigor and discourse in evaluating evidence.

### The Curriculum Dimension

Curriculum is arguably the most visible component of a course and has an important influence on the course climate. Curriculum can be a lesson plan, the overall plan within a course, across a major. Thus, we should carefully consider our decisions regarding which content is included or excluded. 

#### Science Content

Many studies demonstrate that active participation in science leads to an improved sense of belonging and retention in STEM [estrada2011toward, evans_functional_2021, hanauer_inclusive_2017, jordan_broadly_2014, lopatto_genomics_2008, olson_expression-based_2019, shaffer_course-based_2014, waddell_flying_2021](@cite). This active participation requires that students engage with the six facets of science (described in the previous module). Our role as instructors is to establish which facets are most relevant for a specific course and work to bring them to life. The Scientific Teaching Course provides tools for this purpose in the following modules about course design and learning experiences.

#### Diverse Perspectives and Representations

Part of scientific identity includes seeing one’s self and perspectives represented positively through the research questions asked, the outcomes discovered, and the individuals represented as scientists. Instructors decide whose voices are represented—which are all powerful ways to influence belonging in STEM. Strategies can be relatively simple, such as recognizing scientists from a variety of identities and backgrounds [schinske2014teaching](@cite), or complex, such as decolonizing the curriculum, which involves reimagining content and approaches that have historically prioritized Western, white, male-centric knowledge [gichuru2024enhancing](@cite). 

### The Pedagogy Dimension

Pedagogy involves how a course is designed and taught. It also defines how students interact with the content and each other. Once again, the choices we make determine how inclusive the course feels. In the Scientific Teaching module, we demonstrated how poor instruction leads to a pattern of exclusion from STEM that differentially affects students. In contrast, pedagogies that promote a sense of belonging lead to increased persistence in STEM [estrada2011toward](@cite), especially for HEC students [evans_functional_2021, hurtado_diversifying_2009, olson_expression-based_2019, rodenbusch_early_2016, shuster_implementing_2019, waddell_flying_2021](@cite).

## Inclusive Learning in Practice

Let’s examine how the instructor, student, curriculum, and pedagogy dimensions work together to create a course climate that is based on inclusive learning. Below is a summary of several evidence-based practices based on the five dimensions of inclusive teaching.

### Choose Evidence-based Interventions

![Illustration of the five dimensions of inclusive teaching, with a focus on dimensions dealing with evidenced-based interventions: curriculum, climate, and pedagogy.](assets/five-dimensions-of-inclusive-teaching-hori.svg)

Interventions can be incorporated as individual or repeated activities, such as:

- Increase **instructor presence and connection to students** by making eye contact, engaging in positive body movements such as nods and smiles, communicating goals, setting guidelines for student interactions, and encouraging student participation [shea2006study, baker2010impact, andersen1981three, arbaugh2006does](@cite).
- Use **active learning experiences**, in which students actively engage with content and sometimes each other [freeman_active_2014](@cite). You’ll find more examples in the Learning Experiences module.
- Do regular **formative assessments**, in which students have the opportunity to regularly practice and receive feedback (Black and Wiliam, 1998). You’ll find more examples in the Learning Experiences module.
- Encourage **microaffirmations**, which are statements that affirm a student’s capabilities (Estrada et al., 2019)
- Leverage activities that **increase resilience** by reframing social adversity as common and transient [walton_brief_2011](@cite)
- Incorporate interventions that make explicit the **utility value** of a course or its parts [harackiewicz_closing_2016, asher2023utility](@cite).
- Take actions that mitigate **stereotype threat**, which occurs when individuals fear they may confirm negative stereotypes about their social group, which in turn can negatively impact their performance [Steele2002-pt](@cite).

Instructors can also modify overall course structure or infuse practices into an entire course to accomplish an inclusive learning environment. Some examples:

- Create a culture where **failure is a productive and normal part of science**, rather than a judgement on students' identity [petroski2013success, simpson_failure_2017, lopatto2020facilitating, gin2018students, good2012women, koch2008women, cacciotti2015fear](@cite).
- Use **high-structure course design** to elucidate what is expected of students and create predictable patterns [freeman_increased_2011, theobald_active_2020](@cite). You’ll find more on this in the Course Structure module.
- Teach a **course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE)**, in which students engage in research while enrolled in a course [aikens_race_2017, dolan_guide_2021, hurtado_diversifying_2009](@cite). 
- Leverage **universal design for learning** principles, which incorporate accessibility considerations into course design that provide equal access and opportunities for everyone, regardless of their abilities [burgstahler2013universal](@cite).

    #### Commit to Action: Inclusive Learning

    *Call to mind a course you are teaching, have taught, or are planning to teach.*

    Describe 2-3 new actions you could take to promote inclusive learning in your course.

### Consider Identities

![Illustration of the five dimensions of inclusive teaching, with a focus on dimensions dealing with identities: instructors, climate, and students.](assets/five-dimensions-of-inclusive-teaching-vert.svg)

Identity comprises the social, emotional, and professional attributes of an individual (Rus et al., 2013; Peterson et al., 1999). It can be influenced by life experiences, positionality, and power. Identity affects how we choose to present ourselves, relate to others, and prioritize content, which in turn, influences the learning climate.

**Social identity** is defined as the sense of self that comes from membership in a social group and the value attached to membership within that group by society (Tajfel, 1981. p. 255). It can change over time and between contexts (Gee, 2000). Moreover, we are each of us complex persons with multiple social identities that intersect, add up, and produce unique experiences–both for ourselves and how we are viewed by others [crenshaw2013demarginalizing, gordon2008ghostly](@cite). Although social science research has highlighted discrimination against protected social groups, it is also important to recognize the unique joys, values, and experiences that shape what it means to "belong" in a group [tuck2009suspending](@cite). 

**Emotional identity** characterizes how a person responds to their own emotions and the emotions of others. It is informed by experiences, power dynamics, and agency.

**Professional identity** (in our case, teacher identity or STEM instructor identity) encompasses how individuals perceive themselves and construct their professional identities as teachers within educational settings (Yuan & Liu, 2021, p. 2). An instructor’s professional identity is dynamic and influenced by experience and positionality (Sachs, 2005, p.15).

    #### Reflection: Your Identity in Teaching Science

    Your identity matters. Consider the identities that you bring to the learning environment and how they influence your perspectives and the learning environment.

    Write down, on a separate piece of paper for privacy, your:

    - Full name
    - Race
    - Ethnicity
    - Birth country
    - Gender identity 
    - Sexual orientation
    - Veteran status
    - Educational path
    - Family socioeconomic status
    - Health status (mental and physical)
    - Family situation and/or relationship status
    - Circle of friends
    - Hobbies or interests
    - Financial situation

Do you tell your students these attributes? Why or why not?

    What is one way that those attributes could affect your teaching or your interactions with students?

    #### Reflection: Your Students’ Identities 

    We considered our own identities, but it is also important to be aware of who is in our classes. 

    What do you know about your students’ identities and what is important to them? 

    How do their identities and background impact how they experience interactions or activities in class with you and with their peers? 

     How do their identities shape how they decide what is relevant or important?

### Mitigate Biases and Assumptions
Identities aren’t the only thing that influence outcomes in STEM. Biases and assumptions matter, too. For example, biases and assumptions affect how we rate people, which can have consequences for hiring decisions and advancement.

Let’s examine hiring studies as one example of bias affecting outcomes. In one study [Moss-Racusin2012-cm](@cite) 127 biology, chemistry, and physics faculty at six top US research universities received a student resume for a lab manager position. Each resume was randomly assigned a gendered name: “Jennifer” (female) or “John” (male). Otherwise, the applications were identical, and each evaluator saw only one version. Faculty then evaluated the student’s competence and hireability and proposed a salary.

What results would you predict? Click here to find out what happened!

![Science faculty rated male applicants higher than women regarding competence and hireability for a lab manager position (p < 0.001). Scales range from 1 to 7, with 7 being the highest score.](assets/competence_hireability.png)

![Science faculty provided higher salary offers for male applicants than women for a lab manager position (p < 0.01). The gender of the reviewer did not affect scores or salaries. Both men and women faculty scored women students lower and offered lower salaries.](assets/salary.png)

Dozens of studies have compared hiring decisions with the same setup, all yielding the same result: Evaluators are substantially more likely to hire and pay a higher salary if an applicant has a man’s name. **These results have not changed for 50 years.**

In fact, we hold biases about everything imaginable—not just hiring. For a more complete list of the HEC groups affected by bias and assumptions in STEM higher education, check out the supplementary materials for Achieving STEM Diversity: Fix the Classrooms [handelsman_achieving_2022](@cite). An example in a classroom context could look like instructors calling on students they expect will have the right answer or whose name they can pronounce. 

Bias is not inherently bad and is part of human nature. But when bias leads to recurring, systemic inequalities that cause negative socioeconomic impacts and structural inequities, we need to pay attention and effect change.
