# Inclusive Learning

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to...

- Justify why inclusive learning matters for increasing diversity in STEM.
- Explain how instructors, students, curriculum, and pedagogy can influence course climate.
- Practice applying the five dimensions of inclusive teaching to your course.

## Inclusive Learning Defined
Inclusive learning refers to all the factors that contribute to a classroom environment where:

- Students feel a sense of belonging, value, and respect.
- They are provided with the necessary resources and opportunities to learn.

The curriculum, pedagogy, instructors, and students work together to create a course climate that includes and supports students in learning.

There is no shortage of inclusive teaching methods. In fact, the number of choices can be overwhelming. This module distills evidence-based practices that support an inclusive course climate and gives you the chance to evaluate them for your course. It also asks you to consider how your identities and actions influence who feels included or excluded in your course. The examples provided in this module are not comprehensive; many more can be found throughout this Scientific Teaching Course.

## Why Inclusive Learning?

Diversity in STEM starts with inclusive learning environments. Recall from the previous module that a prevailing reason students leave science majors is not because they are incapable, but because science is too often taught in a way that doesn’t inspire them or instill a sense of belonging. Consequently, more than half of the 600,000 US students who declare STEM majors change to a different major before graduating (Thiry et al., 2019), with students from underrepresented backgrounds switching out of STEM at disproportionate rates (Riegle-Crumb, et al, 2019).

Reversing STEM attrition requires us to reimagine how the various components of a classroom work together to create inclusive learning environments.

## A Framework for Inclusive Learning

The Five Dimensions of Inclusive Teaching (Bell, et al. 2016) provides a framework for understanding how instructors, students, curriculum, and pedagogy collectively influence the classroom environment.

At the center of the framework is course climate, which encompasses the atmosphere and environment in which students learn. It is influenced by the other four dimensions: instructors (who we are), students (who we teach), curriculum (what we teach), and pedagogy (how we teach).

**Figure 1.** *Illustration of the five dimensions of inclusive teaching. Four dimensions – instructors, students, curriculum, and pedagogy – interact with each other and collectively influence course climate, which is depicted in the center. The figure is adapted from the five dimensions of diversity and equity in the classroom (Bell et al., 2016), which draws on the dynamics of multicultural teaching and learning framework (Marchesani and Adams, 1992).*

### The Climate Dimension

Course climate is the manifestation of all the decisions that influence the learning environment. As instructors, our role is to examine how we set up and sustain learning experiences to be inclusive (Dewsbury & Brame, 2019; Bell et al., 2016). An inclusive course climate is one where all students feel welcomed, valued, and supported in their learning, regardless of backgrounds and identities (Brame, 2019).
