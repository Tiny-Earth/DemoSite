## Inclusive Learning Defined
Inclusive learning refers to all the factors that contribute to a classroom environment where:

- Students feel a sense of belonging, value, and respect.
- They are provided with the necessary resources and opportunities to learn.

The curriculum, pedagogy, instructors, and students work together to create a course climate that includes and supports students in learning.

There is no shortage of inclusive teaching methods. In fact, the number of choices can be overwhelming. This module distills evidence-based practices that support an inclusive course climate and gives you the chance to evaluate them for your course. It also asks you to consider how your identities and actions influence who feels included or excluded in your course. The examples provided in this module are not comprehensive; many more can be found throughout this Scientific Teaching Course.

## Why Inclusive Learning?

Diversity in STEM starts with inclusive learning environments. Recall from the previous module that a prevailing reason students leave science majors is not because they are incapable, but because science is too often taught in a way that doesn’t inspire them or instill a sense of belonging. Consequently, more than half of the 600,000 US students who declare STEM majors change to a different major before graduating (Thiry et al., 2019), with students from underrepresented backgrounds switching out of STEM at disproportionate rates (Riegle-Crumb, et al, 2019).

Reversing STEM attrition requires us to reimagine how the various components of a classroom work together to create inclusive learning environments.

## A Framework for Inclusive Learning

The Five Dimensions of Inclusive Teaching (Bell, et al. 2016) provides a framework for understanding how instructors, students, curriculum, and pedagogy collectively influence the classroom environment.

At the center of the framework is course climate, which encompasses the atmosphere and environment in which students learn. It is influenced by the other four dimensions: instructors (who we are), students (who we teach), curriculum (what we teach), and pedagogy (how we teach).

**Figure 1.** *Illustration of the five dimensions of inclusive teaching. Four dimensions – instructors, students, curriculum, and pedagogy – interact with each other and collectively influence course climate, which is depicted in the center. The figure is adapted from the five dimensions of diversity and equity in the classroom (Bell et al., 2016), which draws on the dynamics of multicultural teaching and learning framework (Marchesani and Adams, 1992).*

### The Climate Dimension

Course climate is the manifestation of all the decisions that influence the learning environment. As instructors, our role is to examine how we set up and sustain learning experiences to be inclusive (Dewsbury & Brame, 2019; Bell et al., 2016). An inclusive course climate is one where all students feel welcomed, valued, and supported in their learning, regardless of backgrounds and identities (Brame, 2019). 

### The Instructor Dimension

Even though we are scientists, we are human and therefore not objective. As instructors, our identities are influenced by our values, principles, families, scientific disciplines, privileges, struggles, and all the factors that we experience during our lives (Rus et al., 2013; Peterson et al., 1999). Those influences also give us biases that lead to assumptions. 

In aggregate, our identities, biases, and assumptions affect the pedagogical choices we make regarding the content and examples we highlight, as well as the values and skills we expect our students to learn. As a result, the instructor shapes the course climate and therefore each student's learning experience. 

### The Student Dimension

Like instructors, students come to our courses with a composite of many identities and biases. Students interact with their instructors, with each other, and with  content in the context of a course’s climate. Students’ identities and their interactions influence the extent to which they feel a sense of belonging and the likelihood that they will learn the material and eventually persist in STEM. 

#### The Connection between Identity and Belonging

The Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influence (TIMSI) explains the psychological mechanisms underlying belonging in STEM (Estrada et al., 2011). The TIMSI describes three orientations that contribute to student persistence in STEM:

- **Scientific self-efficacy:** Students feel capable of performing the actions needed to be successful in science.
- **Scientific identity:** Students perceive science as part of who they are and feel a sense of belonging within a scientific community.
- **Scientific values:** Students authentically agree with the values of the scientific community, such as the importance of rigor and discourse in evaluating evidence.

### The Curriculum Dimension

Curriculum is arguably the most visible component of a course and has an important influence on the course climate. Thus, we should carefully consider our decisions regarding which content is included or excluded. 

#### Science Content

Many studies demonstrate that active participation in science leads to an improved sense of belonging and retention in STEM (e.g., Estrada et al., 2011; Evans et al., 2021; Hanauer et al., 2017; Jordan et al., 2014; Lopatto et al., 2008; Olson et al., 2019; Shaffer et al., 2014; Waddell et al., 2021). This active participation requires that students engage with the six facets of science (described in the previous module). Our role as instructors is to establish which facets are most relevant for a specific course and work to bring them to life. The Scientific Teaching Course provides tools for this purpose in the following modules about course design and learning experiences.

#### Diverse Perspectives and Representations

Part of scientific identity includes seeing one’s self and perspectives represented positively through the research questions asked, the outcomes discovered, and the individuals represented as scientists. Instructors decide whose voices are represented—which are all powerful ways to influence belonging in STEM. Strategies can be relatively simple, such as recognizing scientists from a variety of identities and backgrounds (Schinske et al., 2017), or complex, such as decolonizing the curriculum, which involves reimagining content and approaches that have historically prioritized Western, white, male-centric knowledge (Gichuru, 2024 ). 

### The Pedagogy Dimension

Pedagogy involves how a course is designed and taught. It also defines how students interact with the content and each other. Once again, the choices we make determine how inclusive the course feels. In the Scientific Teaching module, we demonstrated how poor instruction leads to a pattern of exclusion from STEM that differentially affects students. In contrast, pedagogies that promote a sense of belonging lead to increased persistence in STEM (Estrada et al., 2011), especially for HEC students (Evans et al., 2021; Hurtado et al., 2009; Olson et al., 2019; Rodenbusch et al., 2016; Shuster et al., 2019; Waddell et al., 2021).

## Inclusive Learning in Practice

Let’s examine how the instructor, student, curriculum, and pedagogy dimensions work together to create a course climate that is based on inclusive learning. Below is a summary of several evidence-based practices based on the five dimensions of inclusive teaching.

### Choose Evidence-based Interventions

Interventions can be incorporated as individual or repeated activities, such as:

- Increase **instructor immediacy and presence** by making eye contact, engaging in positive body movements such as nods and smiles, communicating goals, setting guidelines for student interactions, and encouraging student participation (Shea et al., 2006; Baker, 2010; Andersen et al., 1981; Arbaugh & Hwang, 2006).
- Use **active learning experiences**, in which students actively engage with content and sometimes each other (Freeman et al., 2014). You’ll find many examples in the Learning Experiences module.
- Do regular **formative assessments**, in which students have the opportunity to regularly practice and receive feedback (Black and Wiliam, 1998). More in Learning Experiences.
- Encourage **microaffirmations**, which are statements that affirm a student’s capabilities (Estrada et al., 2019)
- Leverage activities that **increase resilience** by reframing social adversity as common and transient (Walton and Cohen, 2011)
- Incorporate interventions that make explicit the **utility value** of a course or its parts (Harackiewicz et al., 2016; Asher et al., 2023).
- Take actions that mitigate **stereotype threat**, which occurs when individuals fear they may confirm negative stereotypes about their social group, which in turn can negatively impact their performance (Steele et al., 2002).

Instructors can also modify overall course structure or infuse practices into an entire course to accomplish an inclusive learning environment. Some examples:

- Create a culture where **failure is a productive and normal part of science**, rather than a judgement on students' identity (Petroski 2006; Simpson and Maltese, 2017; Lopatto et al., 2020; Gin, et al., 2018; Good et al., 2012; Koch et al., 2008; Cacciotti, 2015).
- Use **high-structure course design** to elucidate what is expected of students and create predictable patterns (Freeman et al., 2011; Theobald et al., 2020). More on this in Course Structure.
- Teach a **course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE)**, in which students engage in research while enrolled in a course (Aikens et al., 2017; Dolan and Weaver, 2021; Hurtado et al., 2009). More on this in Learning Experiences.
- Leverage **universal design for learning** principles, which incorporate accessibility considerations into course design that provide equal access and opportunities for everyone, regardless of their abilities (Burgstahler & Cory, 2008).
