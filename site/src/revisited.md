# Scientific Teaching Revisited

**Estimated time to complete:** 10 minutes

## Module Learning Objectives

!!! compat ""

    By the end of this module, you will be able to…

    - Propose a plan that will provide you with opportunities to practice the scientific teaching approaches you have learned about in this course.
    - Propose a plan that will provide you with ongoing evaluation of your course’s learning environment and outcomes.

## Bringing it All Together

Remember from the beginning that scientific teaching is both the *teaching of science* and the *science of teaching*. An instructor who practices scientific teaching:

- Engages students in authentic practices of science
- Approaches their teaching with the spirit of scientific research

The previous modules provided the foundations of knowledge, skills, tools, and mindsets for teaching scientifically. However, you probably did not finish creating your course or updating your instructional materials. This last module prompts you to leave yourself detailed notes about when and how you plan to finish creating the course materials, when you plan to implement them, and how you will approach iterative revisions over time. 

The goal is to continue to create a cohesive course that brings science to life and can be accessed equitably by your students. Over time, we also hope that you continue to enlist your scientific mindset to collect information to improve the course, and that your own skills and mindsets continue to evolve.

## Leaving Yourself a Trail of Breadcrumbs

Below is a summary of the main considerations for scientific teaching to support your ongoing growth and iteration of the course over time. As you complete the STC, make note of which of the following next steps you want to complete so you have a trail of “bread crumbs” to guide your way to when it’s time to return to your scientific teaching path.

### For You as the Instructor

- What are your next steps to build out your course? 
    - Finish and align learning objectives, activities, and assessments 
    - Create detailed instructional materials to support them
    - Work on inclusive learning environment
    - Work on overall course structure
    - Establish a learner-centered syllabus / inclusive welcome materials
    - Other: _____
- When and how will you practice teaching with these new tools?

### For Designing the Course or Instructional Materials

- **Alignment:** How do the activities and assessments reinforce each other and help students progress toward the learning goals?
- **Learning goals:** How do the learning goals and objectives represent the six facets of science?
- **Active learning:** How do the learning activities leverage evidence-based practices?
- **How learning works:** How are the activities scaffolded to promote learning, metacognition, and regular low-stakes feedback?
- **Inclusive learning:** How are the learning activities and the content relevant, accessible, and equitable? How are instructor and student identities accounted for?

### Ongoing Iteration

What do you want to know to guide future iterations and ongoing growth?

- **Self reflection:** What worked, what didn’t, and why? How do you know? What would you keep or change next time? How will you continue to grow and learn?
- **Peer-informed improvements:** How could a colleague provide feedback on course design, your teaching, or the student experience?
- **Data-informed improvements:** What artifacts or assessments provide data about the extent to which learning objectives were met?
- **Student input:** How could students provide feedback about their experiences with the content, experiences, and learning environment?

## Call to Action 

Science is essential for understanding the world around us. Scientists play a critical role in discovering new knowledge and addressing issues related to the environment, public health, and so much more. A diversity of perspectives will be needed to not only find solutions to emerging problems, but also to identify which questions are important. The only way to enlist those diverse perspectives is to stop gatekeeping scientific opportunities from those who have historically been excluded from STEM and instead open the gates.

You have a powerful tool at your fingertips: your classroom. The learning experience in that classroom is in your charge, lending you both opportunity and responsibility to create learning experiences that support students in understanding the world through a scientific lens and to encourage them to apply scientific ways of thinking to the world around them. By engaging in a lifelong journey of discovery through scientific teaching, you and your colleagues can inspire students to become the scientists we need.
