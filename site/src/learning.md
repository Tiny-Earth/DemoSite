## Learning Defined

**Learning** is the acquisition and integration of new information that leads to a change in behavior. It is influenced by each learner’s individual motivations and brain composition; disciplinary content, values, and approaches; and the sociocultural environment [ref].

**Learners** come into every learning experience with prior knowledge, mindsets, and beliefs. They have reasons for enrolling in a course and motivations for engaging with the material. Each learner’s brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons. Each neuron connects to many other neurons, creating a vast and unique network of 100 trillion neural connections within each brain [ref].

Each course brings a unique mixture of course content, skills, and methods. The course **learning objectives** help students understand what is expected of them so they can build on what they already know and emphasize learning new ideas or difficult approaches (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005; Wiggins & McTighe, 2011).

The **learning environment** affects the extent to which students feel a sense of belonging and agency to engage in learning. It is influenced by the instructor’s actions and statements, the instructional choices about which problems or examples matter, as well as cultural factors in society at large [ref].

## Why Learning?

Each of these factors – the learners, objectives, and environment – influence learning. When these factors work together, they create an inclusive learning environment.

Tapping into this alignment requires a shift from thinking about *students* as having deficits toward thinking about the *learning environment* as having deficits. 

How often do we hear things like this? 

- Students don’t know the content.
- They are only here for the grade because it is a required course in the major.
- They don’t have enough math background.
- They didn’t take all the recommended prerequisite courses.
- They don’t know how to study.

Instead, reframe like this:

- Students come to this course with prior knowledge and are here to learn.
- The course content is relevant to global or local problems that interest the students.
- The course will provide tools to support students in gaining the necessary math skills.
- The first week of class will provide background knowledge and resources for everyone.
- The formative assessments will give students the tools they need to study in this course.

Many instructors approach learning with a model of student deficit in which students have “deficiencies” and learning is geared toward fixing them (Griffin, Murray, Care, Thomas & Perri, 2010). In contrast, a model of learning-environment deficit strives to change the classroom and use supportive strategies that benefit all students (Handelsman et al., 2022). Emphasizing what students will learn, rather than what content will be covered, requires instructors to have a growth mindset that focuses on improving the learning environment.

## A Framework for Learning

The theory of **constructivism** explains how people construct their own understanding of the world through experiences and social interactions. It recognizes that learners bring prior knowledge and experiences to learning, and that learning is influenced by sociocultural factors.

**Metacognition** refers to thinking about thinking, when the learner evaluates the extent to which they understand the material and use that information to decide when to move on. Metacognition can happen at any step in the learning process.

**Figure 2.** A framework for how learning works. 

Many things contribute to learning, including one’s prior experiences, stress, situational factors, and motivation. Each of these can create different conditions that either favor learning in general or favor learning a particular aspect of a situation (for example, a familiar smell from childhood can bring back specific memories) (Gold and Korol, 2017). Significant learning experiences commonly involve an important event or relationship to real events, a level of interest or value in the experience, and an opportunity to apply and integrate new knowledge (Fink, 2013).

Neurons communicate with each other to drive everything we do, including how we learn. Learning requires adapting existing neural processes to orchestrate new pathways and new behaviors. Constructing knowledge involves making new neuronal connections and/or enhancing connections that exist.

At a cellular and molecular level, the changing nature, or plasticity, of neuronal connections can lead to long-lasting changes in synaptic connections, neurotransmitter release, receptor number and binding properties (Basett et al., 2017). The consequences of these changes for humans are new behaviors and an ability to use new knowledge. The formation of long-lasting connections, and the storage of this information are what we think of as memory.

The strength of a memory represents how associated the memory is with related knowledge and skills. A brain region called the hippocampus is involved in creating and storing memories. How well you can retrieve a memory depends on how accessible that information is, which can be influenced by how recently you thought about the information as well as other situational cues. Sometimes easily retrieved information is also easily forgotten, because it has not been consolidated and stored (Bjork and Bjork 2011).

### The Difference between Novices and Experts

An expert not only understands many concepts, but can relate them to each other, transfer principles across concepts, and easily add new knowledge to their framework. Novice are still acquiring and connecting information, and as a result, need guidance and practice in constructing their own frameworks. Experts have a conceptual framework that they use to identify concepts or patterns in various contexts so that they can transfer/apply their understanding to solve problems in novel contexts.

            <th scope="row">Connections</th>

### Seven Principles for Learning

This brings us to a set of research-based principles about learning (Ambrose et al., 2010):

1. Prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.
2. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.
3. Expertise requires skills, practice, and application.
4. Motivation determines, directs, and sustains what students do to learn.
5. Goal-directed practice and targeted feedback enhances the quality of learning.
6. Students’ level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate to impact learning.
7. To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning

## Summary of Learning

- An inclusive learning environment accounts for the learners’ prior knowledge and motivations, learning objectives, and sociocultural influences.
- An effective learning experience challenges existing worldviews, then scaffolds opportunities to practice and reinforce the new knowledge, skills, and beliefs.
- Metacognition refers to thinking about thinking.
