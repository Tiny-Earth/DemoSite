# Scientific Teaching Course

## Format of the *Scientific Teaching Course*

The course is modular and designed to be self-paced. The first module provides an overview of scientific teaching and a call to action. Subsequent modules build on that foundation, providing opportunities to engage with the content, practice with the tools, self-assess, reflect, and apply to your own teaching. The final module provides tools to help you synthesize what you learned and identify areas for further development. A [companion workbook is provided in Google drive that you can download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRgQVUMG7SzwS_R8E6g8vLbEOG59vPCXLKTBSN6qmEQ4gvQAatu7GNgGOHzrclMu4__Jth6BUs8iAPq/pub) and use for tracking reflections and designing your course materials as you progress through the course, along with a [template for building a course map](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSt1EQJQim8Mgf7HQrq0BLC4ZKDk3N0mFamRnMcb7a2I35Dv-mhceoVYh4ZALbV9wIMNY1KpiLhoLLj/pub).

## FAQ

### Where do I begin?

Before you begin, we recommend you select one of your STEM courses to revise or build anew as you proceed through the modules. Gather materials you might want to develop or revise as you take the *Scientific Teaching Course*, such as syllabus, learning objectives, lecture materials, assignments or assessments, lab experiments, or instructor guides. Itâ€™s ok if you are starting from scratch.

We recommend starting with the *Scientific Teaching* module, then proceeding through the rest of the modules in order. Each module builds on the content from the previous modules and is self-contained with interactive exercises and self-assessment questions. However, you may begin with any module. The course is designed so that you can work on developing a new course or redesigning an existing course while you are completing it. The course ends with a questionnaire.

### What products will I create during the *Scientific Teaching Course*?

After the course, you will have generated:

- A partially completed course design including parts of the following:
    - Learner-centered syllabus or welcome materials
    - Course map
    - Learning objectives
    - Active learning experiences
    - Assessments
    - Inclusive learning experiences
- A set of your own reflective responses to question prompts
- A plan for ongoing improvements

During the modules, we recommend that you practice using each scientific teaching tool on small parts of your course using the provided workbook and templates. The last module will prompt you to leave yourself detailed notes about when and how you plan to finish creating the course materials, when you plan to implement them, and how you will approach iterative revisions over time. To make space for these new tools, you may have to reconsider the nature and amount of content your students are accountable for learning.

### What will I learn during the *Scientific Teaching Course*?

By the end of the course, you will have gained the skills, knowledge, and confidence to create a learner-centered STEM course. Please refer to the learning objectives in each module for more details.

### How long will it take?

We estimate that each module will take approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete. This includes time to build or re-work small pieces of your course using the provided template. We have curated resources to make your time in the modules efficient and worthwhile, but the extent to which you work on each component and the degree of completion is entirely up to you and will affect the amount of time you spend.

### What data will be collected?

The survey asks several questions about your teaching perspective and practice.

### How will the data be used?

Data will be used to guide course improvements. It may be used for other purposes, such as reporting, publications, demonstrating the effectiveness of the course, or promoting the course.

### How will my data be protected?

We will only report data about individuals anonymously and/or in aggregate, with care not to report data from very small subsets of demographic groups where certain individuals might be identified. Quotes may be used but, unless explicit permission is given, they will remain anonymous and identifying data (e.g., institution or name) will be removed. Only the PIs and project team will have access to identifiable data. Data will be saved in a secure, password-protected location such as Box or OneDrive. Data protection will follow practices outlined by the University of Wisconsin-Madison institutional review board guidelines (IRB protocol 2024-0478).

### Will there be any follow up after the course?

We anticipate self-organized community discussions will emerge over time. If you are interested in coordinating a community, we recommend checking with your colleagues at your institution or through your professional society.
