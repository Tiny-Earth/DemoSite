## Course Design Defined

What is course design?

It is an intentional, reflective process of developing effective learning materials and environments that encourage students to develop their skills and knowledge. 

In designing a course, we set goals and adopt strategies for students and teachers to achieve learning outcomes.

---
## Why Course Design

Science teachers are designers: You select content. You modify it for your courses. You create presentations and you craft lectures. You prepare online course space so students can find the assignments they need. You prepare physical lab space so the flow of traffic does not impede hands-on learning. You plan, you adapt, you iterate.


And like in any type of design—from technology, to paintings, to skyscrapers, and yes, to science courses—you make decisions. Your decisions help you approach your aims, within your constraints. You’ll make decisions about your teaching before the semester begins, while teaching a unit, and after you’ve seen how it all played out. From designing new courses, to overhauling an old design you’ve inherited, and to continuously improving your teaching, as a science teacher you are as much a designer as you are a scientist.

In all three of these roles—teacher, scientist, designer—you hold a number of commitments that are relevant to, inspire, and inform how you carry out your course [flanagan2005values,flanagan2014values,belman2009instructional](@cite). As a teacher, you are likely committed to delivering on the specific learning objectives of your courses. As a scientist, you may be committed to a certain bar of rigor in your work, and as a science teacher you may be committed to instilling a sense of this rigor in your students. And so on.

Only you can know what your own commitments are and the ways they:

- Shape what you aspire to achieve in your work as a science teacher
- Motivate you to pursue your own degree of quality
- Guide you to explore and weigh between design alternatives


### A Rubric for Course Design

The following six statements make up a "rubric" to help gauge effective course design:

1. The course is designed using evidence-based practices.
2. Students likely feel that the course is inclusive, fosters belonging and supports learning.
3. The course materials promote ideas and concepts related to antiracism, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.
4. Students know what is expected of them in the course.
5. Activities and assessments reinforce the learning objectives.
6. Students have multiple chances to interact with the content, with each other, and with the instructional team.

    #### Apply a Rubric for Course Design

    The following description of a course meets these 6 statements. Match each of the bolded parts to the part(s) of the rubric they align with.

    > My primary goal is to create a **supportive environment** where all students **feel a sense of belonging** and are excited to learn about astronomy.
    > 
    > To achieve this, I employ many strategies:
    > 
    > - I like to **learn more about my students** such as their interests, prior knowledge, and career goals.
    > - I then craft my course materials to **include their interests and connections to their lives**.
    > - Additionally, I like to **highlight the various ways different cultures learned about and used** the night sky. For example, Polynesians used celestial knowledge to navigate long-distance ocean voyages.
    > - To increase clarity and transparency, **all learning objectives are provided** in the syllabus and in lecture notes.
    > - **Mastery-oriented rubrics** are also provided to students **to help them know what I'm looking for** in their term papers.
    > - Lastly, my course includes multiple assignments before, during, and after class to help provide **low-stakes opportunities for practice and feedback**. In particular, I like to use the **jigsaw activity** in class so that students have a **sense of ownership and can learn from each other**.

        > My genetics course uses the premiere \$300 textbook that covers all the founding fathers' discoveries. I give two-hour multiple-choice exams from 6-8pm on Tuesdays every 5 weeks. The final is cumulative and all exams are graded on a curve. All content is delivered through the textbook and my lectures. There are no worksheets or homework assignments - I'm not going to tell them what's important and what to study. I pride myself in weeding out students who aren't cut out to be genetics majors. We only want the best of the best in our program.

        > Students in my chemistry course know what is expected of them. The learning objectives are transparent, and we do a variety of student-centered activities in class that help them practice skills related to the objectives. We ask and answer scientific questions with relevance to their lives, and I highlight the work of diverse scientists whenever possible. We connect the science to historical legacies of exclusion and privilege in science. Everything for class is on our learning management system, which ensures students can find materials even if they miss class. I have built a lot of structure in my course such as pre-class readings/quizzes and post-class reflection assignments to help students monitor and progress their learning. I use frequent low-stakes assessments with timely feedback, and I make sure to tell them it's ok to make mistakes while they are learning-that's what class is for. I encourage students to ask questions and to work together to generate their own understanding. I really love talking with my students. They bring so much curiosity and enthusiasm to the class.

        1. How well is the course designed using evidence-based practices? 0 (absent/ unsure), 1 (developing), 2 (present)
        2. How well are students likely to feel that the course is inclusive, fosters belonging and supports learning? 0 (absent/ unsure), 1 (developing), 2 (present)

        > My department chair showed me the data about students in my engineering course. Not only do 18% of them fail each semester, the majority of those who fail are students of color, women, or first-generation students. This really bothered me, so I've been trying to make some changes, but I don't know how to specifically help those students. I mostly stick to the textbook but have added in a few diverse examples of engineers who are women and persons of color. I have a syllabus with some flexibility in due dates, and I let them drop their lowest exam score. In class, I stop and ask if people have questions, but they almost never do. Lab is interactive and students work in pairs. It's worth 30% of their grade, so when they make mistakes and their designs fail, it can adversely affect their final grades. In my course evaluations, students said I wasn't approachable and that I talk too fast, but then nobody comes to my office hours for help even though I say I'm available.

        1. How well is the course designed using evidence-based practices? 0 (absent/ unsure), 1 (developing), 2 (present)
        2. How well are students likely to feel that the course is inclusive, fosters belonging and supports learning? 0 (absent/ unsure), 1 (developing), 2 (present)

## A Framework for Course Design

### Backward Design

Backward design is an instructional approach that emphasizes starting with the end goals in mind (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). What should students know or be able to do after instruction? What are the desired results after the course or a lesson? Engaging in backward design intentionally integrates the curricula and pedagogy dimensions as we consider how to make our courses effective and inclusive for all students.

The process of backward design typically involves three stages:

1. Establishing learning goals and objectives: What skills and knowledge should students learn?
2. Creating assessments that match those objectives: What evidence is needed to know if students have gained the skills and knowledge?
3. Designing learning experiences (instructional materials and activities) that will help students achieve those objectives: What activities will teach these skills and knowledge?

Although backward design emphasizes starting with the end in mind, the process itself is not always strictly linear or sequential.

Educators may revisit stages of the backward design process multiple times to refine goals/objectives, assessments, and learning experiences. Additionally, backward design allows for flexibility in adjusting instructional strategies based on ongoing assessment of student needs and progress. This may result in revisions throughout the learning process, which may not adhere to a strictly "backward" order.

And importantly, this approach focuses on what students should be able to do as a result of their learning.

By prioritizing learning objectives, teachers are able to create more targeted and effective instruction that is better aligned with the needs of their students, rather than designing materials based on covering a certain amount of content.

!!! note ""
    #### Compare Two Courses

    Two professors are covering the same learning objective and using the same assessment in their introductory science courses.

    - Objective: Using the scientific method, design an experiment based on a given hypothesis.
    - Assessment: Given the results of an experiment on antibiotic resistance, design a follow-up experiment that tests a revised hypothesis.

    They have both planned various activities to meet the learning objective:

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Before class: Read a popular science article on the scientific method.</td>
                <td>Before class: Read select passages on the scientific method from the course's textbook.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>In class: Poll students on what a scientific hypothesis is. Brainstorm key features of the scientific method in small groups.</td>
                <td>In class: Clicker Question: What are experimental controls (e.g., positive, negative)? In pairs, analyze data of an Alzheimer's drug and evaluate the hypothesis.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>After class: Diagram the scientific method and label each step with key features.</td>
                <td>After class: Using the in-class data, propose an experiment to test another hypothesis. Include appropriate controls.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </figure>
    ```

    Which of the following choices best describes which course follows principles of backward design and why?

    - Course A. The objective is measured by the assessment question, and the activities prepare students for the assessment.
    - Course A. If students study the activities, they will do well on the assessment.
    - Course B. The objective is measured by the assessment question, and the activities prepare students for the assessment.
    - Course B. Students will meet the objective because the activities are the same as the assessment.

## Course Design in Practice

### Setting learning goals and learning objectives

Learning goals and learning objectives are two key components of instructional design that guide the development of curriculum and assessments:

- **Learning goals** are broad descriptions of what students will understand and learn. They describe the overall goal or purpose of an instructional unit, and do not have to be directly measurable with a single assessment. A learning goal can be focused on behavior, skills, or content, and should be linked to the even broader goals of a curriculum or program.
- **Learning objectives** are specific, action-oriented, and measurable statements that describe the knowledge and skills that students are expected to demonstrate as a result of their learning. Objectives are narrower and more focused than learning goals and are designed to be achievable within a particular time frame and level of instruction. Learning objectives are aligned to learning goals, and achievement of specific learning objectives should lead to progression towards a learning goal.

One way to visualize the difference between the two is to think about learning goals as the destination on a map or GPS, while learning objectives are the individual steps or directions that must be followed to reach that destination.

!!! note ""
    #### Identify Goals and Objectives

    Which of the following statements are learning goals, and which are learning objectives?
    
    - Code, test, and debug simple algorithms using programming languages such as Python or Java.
    - Foster an understanding of the ethical and social responsibilities of engineers and their role in sustainable development and environmental protection.
    - Appreciate the relevance of physics in various fields, such as technology, engineering, and medicine.
    - Display proper techniques for preparing and handling laboratory chemicals, including safety methods and hazard precautions.
    - Identify and manipulate algebraic expressions, including equations, inequalities, and functions, using appropriate rules of algebra.
    - Understand the relationship between physical structure and physiological function at the cellular and systemic levels.

### Writing Effective Learning Goals

Learning goals are at a larger scale than learning objectives, describing broad outcomes at the course-level.

An instructor may have only five or so learning goals for an entire course. Because a goal is not directly measured by a single assessment question, it can use terms such as understand and appreciate, which should be avoided for learning objectives.

To write an effective learning goal, we suggest the following:

- Think about the larger purpose or aims of the course you are designing. What do you want students to be able to do with the knowledge they gain in this course?
- Goals can be ambitious and even philosophical--they communicate that "big picture" feeling to the students.
- It might be helpful to think about what you would want your students to remember or understand about the course 5 years from now.
- Write the goal in broad terms but with enough specificity to provide purpose and direction for instructional design.

Examples:

1. Students will understand the water cycle as a complex process that involves the continuous movement and transformation of water through the environment.
2. Students will recognize the importance of the water cycle in sustaining life on earth and the implications of human activity on this process.
3. Students will develop critical thinking skills to analyze and evaluate the impact of changes in the water cycle on ecosystems and human societies.

!!! note ""
    #### Give Advice for Learning Goals

    The following learning goals come from Professor Nguyen's earth science course.

    1. Students will explain the causes and effects of plate tectonics and how this process has shaped the surface of the Earth over millions of years.
    2. Students will explore the structure and composition of the Earth's interior and the relationship between geologic features such as mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes.
    3. Students will understand Earth's natural systems.

    Write feedback you would give to Professor Nguyen if they were your peer, such as:

    - Areas that are too specific or too broad.
    - If a statement is a learning objective, not a goal.
    - Modifications to make the statement into a more effective learning goal.

### Writing Effective Learning Objectives

Learning objectives are at a smaller grain size than learning goals and describe specific outcomes at the topic level.

```@raw html
<!-- `TODO I think we need to clarify here that the step is NOT to just come up with 2 to 5 things at random, but to (1) come up with a RICH understanding of the objective and imagine ALL the ways learners might demonstrate that, bring their background knowledge to it, etc. (2) and THEN whittle that down to 2 to 5 objectives that SPAN that full understanding of the goal.` -->
```

A general suggestion is to have two to five learning objectives per topic, depending on its complexity. Although learning objectives are often content-focused, they can also include gaining competence in a new skill or developing a certain type of knowledge or expertise. Learning objectives should be designed to be achievable and realistic but also challenging enough to promote growth and progress.

To write an effective learning objective, we suggest the following:

- **Start with an action verb:** An effective learning objective should always begin with a verb that describes the specific skill or knowledge that students are expected to demonstrate. Examples of commonly used verbs include "identify," "analyze," "describe," "compare," "explain," and "design."
- **Be specific:** The objective should clearly state what the student is expected to learn or achieve. Avoid vague or overly general language that could be open to interpretation.
- **Be measurable:** The objective should be written in a way that allows the student's progress or achievement to be measured directly. Use concrete, observable terms that can be assessed through a variety of methods, such as tests, projects, or essays.
- **Be realistic:** The objective should be achievable within the context of the course unit and based on a reasonable level of prior knowledge or skill.
- **Align with learning goals:** The objective should align with a larger learning goal.

!!! note ""
    #### Align Goals and Objectives

    For each learning objective below, describe how it aligns with one or more specific learning goals further below:

    **Objectives:**
    
    1. Predict how changes to the natural water cycle process from human activities affect other lifeforms on Earth.
    2. Explain the connections between the various stages of the water cycle.
    3. Evaluate the effects of droughts, floods, and water pollution on various civilizations around the globe.
    4. Describe the water cycle and its different stages, including precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, surface runoff, and groundwater storages.
    5. Analyze the human impact on the water cycle, including deforestation, urbanization, and climate change.

    **Goals:**

    1. Students will understand the water cycle as a complex process that involves the continuous movement and transformation of water through the environment.
    2. Students will recognize the importance of the water cycle in sustaining life on earth and the implications of human activity on this process.
    3. Students will develop critical thinking skills to analyze and evaluate the impact of changes in the water cycle on ecosystems and human societies.


### Bloom's Taxonomy

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for categorizing educational goals, objectives and assessment by levels of cognitive complexity and specificity (Bloom, 1959).

Since its development, it has become a widely used tool for designing and assessing instruction. The taxonomy consists of six levels, where each level builds upon the prior (McNulty, 2019):

1. **Remember:** Can the learner recall or retain the information? Action verbs: define, duplicate, identify, list, memorize, name, recall, recognize, repeat, state
2. **Comprehend:** Can the learner explain ideas or concepts? Action verbs: classify, describe, discuss, explain, locate, paraphrase, report, select, summarize, translate
3. **Apply:** Can the learner use information in a new way? Action verbs: choose, demonstrate, dramatize, draw, employ, execute, illustrate, implement, interpret, operate, perform, sketch, solve, use
4. **Analyze:** Can the learner distinguish between different parts? Action verbs: compare, contrast, deconstruct, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, infer, investigate, organize, predict, question, test
5. **Evaluate:** Can the learner justify a stand or decision? Action verbs: appraise, argue, assess, criticize, critique, defend, judge, justify, prioritize, support, value
6. **Create:** Can the learner create a new product or point of view? Action verbs: assemble, build, compose, construct, design, develop, devise, formulate, invent, plan, produce, write

The framework is used to progressively move learners based on their prior knowledge and abilities from lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS) to higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS).

Action verbs appropriate for each level can be chosen to communicate the cognitive level of the objective or assessment.

There are many other ways to characterize cognitive levels; we recommend Bloom's taxonomy because it is straightforward and easy to use.

However, since it can be difficult to distinguish between the 6 levels of Bloom's taxonomy, we prefer to divide Bloom's by LOCS and HOCS.

In general, levels 1 and 2 are LOCS and levels 3-6 are HOCS. But depending on the context and what information the student is given, exercises written for higher Bloom's levels such as levels 3 (Apply) and 5 (Evaluate) can be considered LOCS. Often, the distinction depends on the novelty of the task. For example, if students do an evaluation activity in class (HOCS) and encounter the same exercise on an assessment, then it's no longer an evaluation, but a recall task (LOCS) that reinforces what was learned in class.

!!! note ""
    #### Practice Bloom's Taxonomy

    For each assessment prompt below, identify if targets a lower-order cognitive skill (LOCS) or higher-order cognitive skill (HOCS):

    1. Design an experiment to test one of Newton's laws of motion, including the necessary equipment, data collection methods, and analysis.
    2. Use Figure 3 in the textbook to draw your own model that demonstrates one or more of Newton's laws of motion, including the necessary variables and assumptions.
    3. Define Isaac Newton's three laws of motion, including examples of each.
    4. Critique the validity of an experiment or study that uses Newton's laws of motion to explain a physical phenomenon, including its limitations and potential sources of error.
    5. Explain the difference between mass and weight.
    6. Considering the forces acting on an object in motion (direction and magnitude), predict the resultant motion of the object using Newton's laws.

    #### Raising Learning Objective Bloom Levels

    Professor Kim realizes that many of the learning objectives for his botany course are at the Remember level of Bloom's taxonomy (Level 1).
    
    To ensure that his students go beyond mere memorization and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, Professor Kim needs to articulate learning objectives for higher order skills.

    One objective he needs to reword is:

    > Label the parts of a plant cell and recall their functions, including the cell wall, nucleus, chloroplasts, and mitochondria.

    Help Professor Kim by rewriting this objective into two new learning objectives at two different Bloom's levels above Level 1.
    
    You can use this list of action verbs to help reword the objective:

    1. **Remember:** define, duplicate, identify, list, memorize, name, recall, recognize, repeat, state
    2. **Comprehend:** classify, describe, discuss, explain, locate, paraphrase, report, select, summarize, translate
    3. **Apply:** choose, demonstrate, dramatize, draw, employ, execute, illustrate, implement, interpret, operate, perform, sketch, solve, use
    4. **Analyze:** compare, contrast, deconstruct, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, infer, investigate, organize, predict, question, test
    5. **Evaluate:** appraise, argue, assess, criticize, critique, defend, judge, justify, prioritize, support, value
    6. **Create:** assemble, build, compose, construct, design, develop, devise, formulate, invent, plan, produce, write

### Determine acceptable evidence and align objectives with assessments

Once you have learning objectives that are aligned to learning goals, the next step is to design assessments that are aligned to the learning objectives.

Why is this such a critical step? Assessments drive learning--students will study for what is on the test. Misalignment between learning objectives and assessments can negatively impact student performance (O'Neill, et al., 2010), and students do not know how to study.

Imagine a student studies for an exam by solving problems and designing potential experiments, only to find that the exam is all memorization. The student may rightfully feel frustrated, thinking they "wasted time" over-studying.

Now imagine the opposite scenario, where a student presumes the exam will have lower order cognitive questions, but the exam has mostly higher order cognitive questions. The student is unlikely to perform well and will be frustrated that the course materials did not adequately prepare them for the exam.

In both cases, students are not sure how to study for future exams.

### Gauging Alignment

Alignment helps to promote consistency and transparency, providing students with clear expectations and enabling them to gauge their progress towards expertise of the subject matter.

Let's look at an example of alignment between a learning objective and assessment. Here's a learning objective we saw previously:

> Students will be able to explain the connections between the various stages of the water cycle.

What is an appropriate assessment question? Since this learning objective is at the Comprehend level, the assessment should test student knowledge at the Comprehend level. Some options might be:

- Give an example of how the process of condensation leads to precipitation in the water cycle.
- Compare the connections in two models of the water cycle.
- In what ways does the stage of infiltration rely on the previous stages of the water cycle, like precipitation and surface runoff?

!!! note ""
    #### Align Objectives and Assessments: Part One

    Compare the following learning objective with a test item. Are they aligned? Explain your reasoning.

    - **Learning Objective:** Describe how biologists study the history of the diversity of life on earth.
    - **Exam Question:** Having reached the planet Alpha-06 in a distant galaxy, humans disagree as to the origin of life on the planet. Some say it was planted on many occasions from distant galaxies. Others think it arose and diversified on the planet. What biological data would you collect to support or refute the latter hypothesis? (Use the earth's biodiversity as a model.)

### Alignment to Activities

The learning goals, learning objectives, and assessments have been proposed. Now it's time to design the activities.

We will explore developing activities in more detail in a later module. For now, we'll highlight a few key ideas.

Activities should be aligned with assessment questions to ensure that students are given the opportunity to practice and demonstrate proficiency in the intended learning objectives. For example, it would be unfair to ask students to analyze graphs on an exam if students had never practiced analyzing figures during class or on homework assignments.

In addition, this alignment maximizes the effectiveness of the instructional design and enables accurate measurement of student learning outcomes. Continuing the last example, an instructor cannot conclude how well their curriculum advanced students' abilities to analyze graphs based on exam performance. Since the students did not have any opportunities to practice, their exam performance is based on prior knowledge, skills, and experiences, not on learning of class content.

Let's look at the previous example of a learning objective and assessment question.

> Learning Objective: Students will be able to explain the connections between the various stages of the water cycle.
> 
> Assessment: In what ways does the stage of infiltration rely on the previous stages of the water cycle, like precipitation and surface runoff?

What might be an appropriate activity for students to gain practice toward answering the assessment question? Some options might be:

- Students construct a diagram that shows each stage of the water cycle. They can label each stage and explain how water moves through the cycle.
- Students watch a video of someone conducting an soil absorption experiment using sand, gravel, and clay. Students then discuss how much water is absorbed from the simulated precipitation and simulated runoff.
- Students compare and contrast how the water cycle varies depending on the climate, such as a tropical rainforest versus a desert.

As before, activities should be aligned to the Bloom's level of the assessment questions. In this example, the learning objective, assessment, and activity are all at a lower-order cognitive level. If an instructor wishes to include assessments at a higher-order level, then additional activities must be designed to help progress students to that level.

Ideally, multiple activities are leveraged to help students get more practice, gain expertise toward higher-order skills, and engage a diversity of students in learning.

    #### Align Objectives and Assessments: Part Two

    Professor Gupta has the following assessment question in their astronomy class:

    > Astronomers have discovered a new star and have been collecting data on it such as its size, temperature, and luminosity. Using their data, identify the star's stage of stellar evolution and explain your reasoning.

    Which of the following activities would NOT help students gain skills and practice to answer this assessment question?
    
    - A. Students evaluate the evidence for several origin of the universe theories, including the Big Bang and alternative cosmological models.
    - B. Students compare the properties of different types of stars and their predicted stages of stellar evolution.
    - C. Students work in groups to complete a case study on the discovery of Earendel, the farthest star recorded.
    - D. Students practice reading diagrams that depict the evolutionary tracks of stars based on luminosity and temperature.

    <!-- `TODO see comment above, I think we need to draw out that they should think about all the complexity of how a goal can be demonstrated, what background students bring to it, etc.` ->
    ```

    *Answer in your workbook:*

    1. Reflect on and write your course goals. What is the purpose of this course? What big questions will it answer? What big problems will it aim to solve? What ways of thinking will it elucidate?
    2. Based on these course-level learning goals, think about how your course is broken up into units and identify the topics within each unit.
    3. Next, develop learning objectives that address each unit's topic. These are measurable and specific objectives that will inform you and your students on how well they learned the course content.
    4. Write out the learning objectives for each day of class. What will students learn? What will they be able to do? How do these objectives fit together within a unit?
    5. Plan your assessments. How will students demonstrate whether the objectives are achieved?
    6. Plan your activities. What activities will help students achieve the objectives? How will they practice their skills, learn knowledge, and gauge progress toward the learning objectives?

## Module Learning Objectives

!!! compat ""
    By the end of this module, you will be able to...
      - Compare low and high structure course designs and describe the benefits of high structure.
      - Describe the advantages of a learner-centered syllabus.
      - Make a plan for incorporating high-impact practices into your own course structure.

## Course Structure Defined

Course structure refers to the organizational system of a course, including schedule, format, content, communication modes and overall themes. A well-structured course communicates all of these components to students and ensures they have access to each component.

How the course is structured can contribute to making the course inclusive for diverse students. As we structure our courses and plan out the details of our course design, it is also important to consider how we communicate our course design with students in our syllabus and our course can be inclusive and accessible for all students.

## A Framework for Course Structure

The structure of a course and organization of its content, activities, experiences, and assessments lie on a continuum from low to high. Low structure courses have few opportunities for engagement and assessment whereas high structure courses embed multiple opportunities for engagement and frequent assessments (Beck & Roosa, 2020). Low structure courses assume that students know how to efficiently work with course materials in and outside of class. However, data suggest that many students do not implement effective study strategies nor time management skills (Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012). High structure courses scaffold student learning with increased engagement and practice and by decoding the learning process through clear and accessible learning goals and expectations (Beck & Roosa, 2020).

### The Impact of High Structure Courses

Increasing a course's structure has many implications for student learning and their educational experience.

- **Student failure rates** were lower in a moderately structured course design and were **dramatically lower in a highly structured course design** (Freeman et al., 2011)
- A "moderate-structure" intervention **increased course performance for all student populations**, but worked **disproportionately well for black students and first-generation students**. Students also consistently reported completing the assigned readings more frequently, spending more time studying for class, and feeling an increased sense of community (Eddy & Hogan, 2014)
- Implementing a hybrid course format with high structure improved exam performance for **traditionally underrepresented students** (Gavassa et al., 2019)
- A highly structured course design improved the performance of all students in a college-level introductory biology class and **reduced the achievement gap between disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged students** (Haak et al., 2011)

### Show Me the Data!

Freeman and colleagues measured failure rates in a major's introductory biology course, while varying the structure of the course. One instructor taught the course in $6$ iterations using a low structure, moderate structure, or high structure course design (2011). The researchers found that the difference between the proportion of students predicted to fail and the actual proportion failing decreased with increasing structure. ($n = 2267$, $*p = 0.06$, $**p = 0.0004$).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs43.png)

!!! note "" 
    #### Evaluate the Data Yourself

    Eddy and Hogan (2014) used a similar study structure, comparing exam performance in traditional vs. increased structure sections of the same course. The figure below shows point estimates for exam performance (% correct) based on a regression model that included (A) race and ethnicity and (B) first-generation status.

    What conclusions can you draw from these data? (Check all that apply.)

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs44.png)

    - Exam performance will likely not be affected by course structure.
    - All students are expected to perform worse on exams in high structure courses.
    - All students are expected to perform better on exams in high structure courses.
    - Students from communities historically excluded from STEM aren't expected to show much improvement.
    - Students from communities historically excluded from STEM are expected to show greater improvements.

Remember, a high structure course has multiple opportunities for engagement and practice and makes clear the learning goals and expectations (Beck & Roosa, 2020). Eddy and Hogan provide a table that shows how adding in more graded preparatory assignments, student in-class engagement, and graded review assignments increases course design (2014).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs45.png)

Preparatory assignments are tasks or activities given to students prior to a class or lesson to help them prepare for upcoming content. Examples: reading assigned texts, watching videos, researching a topic, completing practice exercises.

Graded review assignments are tasks or assessments that evaluate students' understanding, comprehension, and recall of previously covered material. Examples: case studies, writing assignments, discussion posts, quizzes, projects.

    #### Increasing the Course Structure

    Professor Ali wants to transform her lecture-based chemistry course into a higher structure course, but is feeling overwhelmed. What are some possible small changes Professor Ali can make to her Week 1 course map to modify it from a low structure to a moderate structure? (Select all that apply.)

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs46.png)

    - Add a homework assignment that covers concepts from class such as entropy.
    - Add a brief pre-class quiz on principles of energy conservation.
    - Have students complete example problems in class and use small group discussions.
    - Add in a few clicker questions that elicit students' prior knowledge on the week's concepts.

### Learner-Centered Syllabi

The syllabus offers one of the first opportunities for instructors to communicate with their students about the course and begin building an inclusive learning environment. The **conventional syllabus** is *content-focused*, providing a brief overview of the course subject matter followed by a weekly outline of topics to be covered, and a list of assignments and course activities with relative grading weights and due dates.

A **learner-centered syllabus** also provides basic course information, but **it shifts the emphasis** from what the instructor will cover in the course *to what learning outcomes students will achieve by the end of the course* (Johnson, 2006). It explains how learning will be assessed and offers information and tools to promote student learning and intellectual development in an inclusive environment. It establishes the responsibilities of the instructor(s) and students for achieving course goals. In short, the learner-centered syllabus "becomes an invitation to share responsibility for successful learning" (O'Brien et al., 2008, p. 22).

In his book, "What the Best College Teachers Do," Ken Bain (2004) describes three parts of what he calls "the promising syllabus":

1. **Highlight the promises or opportunities.**
    - What kinds of questions will the course help students answer?
    - What kind of intellectual, physical, emotional, or social abilities will it help them develop?
    - Why is the course relevant?
2. **Explain what students will do to meet those promises.**
    - What are the learning activities (e.g., activities, assignments, readings) that will be used in the course?
    - How will they learn from the course resources, the instructional team, and each other?
    - Give students a sense of agency in their education
3. **Discuss how students will engage in the learning process.**
    - How will the instructor and students best "understand the nature and progress of their learning?"
    - How will learning be evaluated?
    - How will all students feel included in the learning process and welcome as scientists?

    #### Learner-Centered Syllabus

    !!! details "Click to see an example excerpt of a learner-centered syllabus"
        The following is excerpted from Dr. Cara Gormally's asynchronous introductory biology class for non-majors (bilingual-American Sign Language & English).

        **What we'll actually do**

        - You're likely taking this class because it's required for your major.
        - My goal: make this class actually useful to your life.
        - Together, we'll make this class meaningful for ourselves. How will we do that?
        - We'll learn biology relevant to our lives: when a person is most likely to get pregnant; how Covid-19 vaccines work; why we have skin color; how antidepressants work; what we can do to slow climate change; and why we should limit plastic use.
        - There's no textbook; we'll read and watch high quality enjoyable articles and videos.
        - We'll learn how to answer questions we have related to biology, for example about health or the environment.
        - I hope you're excited about our class--I am so excited to get to know you all and do this work together! This work feels real and important to me. I hope you think so, too.

        **Diversity: it makes our class better**

        - **Build community through discussion:** Though we won't meet face-to-face, we'll learn about each other and build a community through our discussions.
        - **Diversity strengthens us:** The diversity that we all bring to this class is a resource, strength and benefit to our class. I'm committed to anti-racism and I believe Black Lives Matter. Everyone belongs here in my classroom if you want to be here. In this class, we'll use materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, national origin, ethnicity, race, culture, etc. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.
        - **You make our class what it is.** Our class will be awesome because of the diversity of perspectives, thoughts, and experiences that we will share through our work. Who you are, what you bring to our class, your perspective--it's important.

    Now that you've seen a learner-centered syllabus, reflect on your own syllabus. (If you do not have one, think about a traditional syllabus or one from a course you've taken.) Think about the elements in a learner-centered syllabus and the components of your syllabus.

    What are two things you could change in your syllabus to make it more learner-centered? You can use these prompts to help you re-imagine your syllabus:
    - What are the promises or opportunities presented by the instructor?
    - What activities will students do in order to meet those promises?
    - How will students track progress of their learning (i.e., how will learning be evaluated)?

## Course Structure in Practice

### Time to start building your course schedule

```@raw html

Course design includes all dimensions of inclusive teaching: as we focus on designing a course, we should consider ourselves, the curriculum, our pedagogy, and our students.
As we design a course, we should intentionally include ways for students to engage in the different facets of science

## Summary of Course Design and Course Structure

- Backward design is an approach to course or curriculum design that involves starting with the end goals or outcomes and then designing assessments and then activities that align with these goals.
- Learning goals and learning objectives are statements of what learners are expected to achieve, but they differ in their level of specificity and scope.
- Bloom's taxonomy is a framework for categorizing educational goals and objectives into a hierarchy of six levels, ranging from simple recall of information to complex, analytical thinking. By using Bloom's taxonomy to guide learning objectives, educators can design learning experiences that promote deeper understanding and critical thinking.
- High structure course design involves creating a highly organized plan for the course with clearly defined expectations and a well-defined schedule. This approach focuses on structuring the learning environment for students and providing multiple opportunities for engagement and practice.
