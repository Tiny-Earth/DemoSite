## Scientific Teaching Defined

Scientific teaching is both the *teaching of science* and the *science of teaching*. An instructor who practices scientific teaching:

- Engages students in authentic practices of science
- Approaches their teaching with the spirit of scientific research

Scientific teaching combines intentional instructional decisions with iterative, evidence-based improvements to create inclusive learning experiences, which, in turn, support students learning science. 

### Goals of Scientific Teaching

The goals of scientific teaching are to:

- Infuse scientific thinking into teaching and learning.
- Increase diversity in STEM.

Embedded in this undertaking is a challenge to all scientists to bring to teaching the critical thinking, rigor, creativity, and spirit of experimentation that defines research [handelsman_scientific_2004](@cite). This includes drawing on the research about effective teaching and learning to shape our approaches.

Scientific teaching also posits that teaching science should capture the spirit of discovery in the classroom in ways that include  all students. Teaching scientifically can open pathways for all students to engage in science and bring joy to teaching.

## Why Scientific Teaching?

### Effective Science Education

Effective science education is equitable science education: Scientific teaching is needed to create a diverse and creative workforce equipped to address emerging global and local problems. Increasing diversity in STEM requires drawing from historically excluded groups. The future workforce should match the demographics of the world’s citizens and take advantage of underutilized talent in all demographic groups.

> __*Effective science education is equitable science education.*__

Yet inequities plague higher education, quelling STEM workforce diversity. Opportunity gaps between overrepresented and underrepresented students have been called “one of the most urgent and intractable problems in higher education” (Bensimon, 2005, p. 99). The inequities in college science education continue to deny opportunities to historically excluded communities (HECs): groups and individuals who have traditionally been underrepresented and denied full rights, privileges, and participantion in STEM education. HECs include but are not limited to women, people of color, people with disabilities, caregivers, LGBTQIA+ students, first-generation students, and low-income students [Asai2020-bb](@cite).

To achieve an equitable STEM workforce, we must address the structural, individual, intentional, and unintentional biases that:
- Discourage HEC students from pursuing STEM
- Limit professors, departments, and institutions from actively working toward challenging systematic inequalities
- Obscure “opportunities for all faculty and all students to analyze power and privilege in classrooms, in peer groups, in departments, in disciplines, in institutions, and in society” [chikkatur2023rethinking](@cite)

### What the US Reports Say about Science Education

For decades, numerous reports have called for science education reform, citing overwhelming evidence that effective and equitable science education requires widespread adoption of evidence-based practices. Highlights of these evolving arguments include:

- Science for All Americans (American Association for the Advancement of Science [AAAS], 1989) called for a scientifically literate public and charged higher educators with teaching scientific “habits of mind.” The report noted that employers demanded efficient and effective employees with problem-solving capabilities, the ability to work in teams, and analytical skills, yet students were unprepared for these demands.
- Bio2010 [bio20102003transforming](@cite) recommended that science curriculum should reflect the nature of science as a dynamic, interdisciplinary, and rapidly changing frontier, rather than a static body of facts.
- Vision and Change (AAAS 2008; 2011) furthered the Bio2010 recommendations by enumerating key biology concepts and science skills, encouraging teaching practices that focused on these concepts and skills, and calling for more research in STEM higher education.
- Engage to Excel [president2012report](@cite) illuminated national STEM workforce shortages, including racial and gender disparities. The report purported that addressing these weaknesses required improving undergraduate STEM education. The report recommended widespread adoption of active learning strategies and undergraduate research experiences, citing dozens of studies demonstrating their effectiveness.
- Indicators for Monitoring Undergraduate STEM Education, a National Academies report, reinforced goals for improving the quality and impact of undergraduate STEM education [dibner2018indicators](@cite) by engaging students in evidence-based educational practices. They broadened the call to strive for inclusion by providing equitable access to STEM opportunities.
- Levers for Change [american2019levers](@cite) noted that the benefits of active learning extended beyond knowledge and skills to include “attitudes, sense of belonging, and persistence in STEM” and again pleaded for widespread adoption of evidence-based strategies to support students.
- The Federal Strategic Plan for Advancing STEM Education and Cultivating Talent (CoSTEM, 2024) proposed organizing a plan for coordinating federal agencies across give areas: STEM engagement, teaching and learning, workforce development, research and innovation, and environments. The report called out course-based research experiences as an effective tool for providing students with access and opportunity to STEM research.

Despite these findings, 70% of instructors have reported extensive use of lecturing in their courses, rather than evidence-based instructional strategies [american2019levers, stains_anatomy_2018](@cite), citing the absence of formal pedagogical training as one of the main reasons [walczyk2007obstacles](@cite). The good news is that faculty who receive pedagogical training are more likely to seek innovative teaching methods and implement learner-centered practices (Marsh & Hattie, 2002; Walczyk & Ramsey, 2003).

### STEM has an Equity Problem

The problem of not using evidence-based practices is compounded when we ignore the role of systemic inequities in US higher education, where underrepresentation in STEM is prevalent.
More than half of the approximately 600,000 college students who intend to major in STEM switch to other fields [thiry_talking_2019, handelsman_achieving_2022](@cite).

Although a disheartening 42% of white students leave STEM majors, the problem is much worse for students of color: 58% of Latine students and 66% of Black students leave STEM [riegle2019does](@cite).

The differential pattern of exclusion from STEM affects students not only according to race and ethnicity; talented college students from HECs also leave at higher rates [thiry_talking_2019](@cite).

Most of those who leave a STEM major have the interest, confidence, and aptitude to be successful in STEM, but early classroom experiences can dampen their interest and actively exclude them from persisting (Thiry et al., 2019; Estrada et al., 2019). Their departures after gateway STEM courses represent a major talent drain from the system. To achieve an equitable educational enterprise, we must address the structural, individual, intentional, and unintentional biases that discourage HEC students from pursuing STEM.

Therefore, this Scientific Teaching Course focuses on what instructors have agency to change: course design and the classroom environment.

### Effective Science

Effective science is inclusive science. To answer the increasingly complex science questions of the future, we need to ensure that students develop a working understanding of how science is done. The rapid expansion of scientific knowledge means students need to be prepared to solve global problems and navigate the difference between evidence-based claims and opinions. Whether they major in biology, art history, math, or elementary education, college-educated students should understand the basic principles of the world around them. When students actively engage in scientific practices, they develop a more robust scientific self-efficacy and identity [estrada_toward_2011](@cite). Equally important, students need to appreciate the origins of scientific information, think critically about new problems and situations, and sustain a lifelong curiosity about the world around them.

> __*Effective science is inclusive science.*__

Diversity within the scientific community supports the broadening of participation in STEM fields.  When students witness diverse scientist identities and engage in solving real-world problems, they connect with and envision themselves as part of the scientific community [ref].

These factors—positive self-efficacy, identity, and connection with scientific values—lead to increased persistence in STEM, especially for students from communities that have been historically excluded [estrada_toward_2011](@cite). Broadening participation in STEM is essential for asking meaningful questions, addressing inequities, and ensuring that STEM benefits everyone.

### Effective Teaching

Effective teaching helps students develop science skills. Authentically integrating science into teaching requires moving beyond a mindset of “covering the content” and toward designing experiences where students “uncover the content.” This active engagement with the content helps students develop the essential knowledge, skills, and habits of mind that align with how science is practiced.

> __*Effective teaching helps students develop science skills.*__

Instructors who identify overarching concepts and broad themes can help students to organize complex information and deepen their understanding. They also help students integrate scientific knowledge with authentic practices and account for students' diverse identities, beliefs, and experiences. This shift doesn’t mean students don’t learn facts; it means they learn how to organize these facts and apply what they have learned in authentic contexts.

### The Three I’s of Effective Teaching

Effective teaching is intentional, inclusive, and iterative. Effective teaching creates learning experiences for students to engage in doing science—more on that in upcoming modules. Effective teaching also means approaching your teaching with the same rigor and spirit—the same intentionality, inclusiveness, and iterativeness—of your scientific research.

> __*Effective teaching is intentional, inclusive, and iterative.*__

Scientific teaching aims to bring a philosophy and framework to teaching that makes the process more rigorous, reflective, and evaluative. Drawing from discovery and evidence-based strategies, scientific teaching provides a model for teaching that parallels science research. Rather than allowing a haphazard approach to designing daily lectures, scientific teaching emphasizes intentional course-level planning, using empirical evidence and data to inform instructional decisions. This approach allows courses to evolve over time using student learning as the driving evidence.

Like science, these teaching principles take time to practice and implement. Also like science, we advocate that you select from practices that demonstrate positive student outcomes and carefully evaluate which approaches will work best in your context.

    #### Reflection: Motivations

    Which reasons for incorporating the practices of science into your course are most motivating for you personally?

    - Prepare students for the scientific workforce and challenges of today’s society
    - Cultivate informed citizens
    - Foster critical thinking
    - Increase interest in science
    - Humanize science
    - Broaden participation in science
    - Increase equity of science

    Why do you believe you selected the reasons above that you did? What about them motivates you?

## A Framework for Scientific Teaching

The main framework for scientific teaching is the process of science itself: how we ask and answer questions and what questions are explored.

Most of us are familiar with the scientific method, which asks us to make an observation, develop a hypothesis, design an experiment, collect and analyze data, and summarize findings. However, anyone who engages in science knows there is more to science than experimentation.

The six facets of science expand on the scientific method to include other hallmarks of research and discovery, contextualized for undergraduate STEM education. The facets below are largely derived from the literature around undergraduate research [ref NAP, Dolan etc] and provide a framework for engaging students in scientific inquiry through the courses that we teach.

### The Six Facets of Science

![Illustration of the six facets of science: Science practices, iteration, discovery, authenticity, ownership, and relevance](assets/six-facets-of-science.svg)

The six facets of science include:

1. Science practices: Ask questions, generate hypotheses, carry out investigations, analyze and communicate data
2. Iteration: Identify and resolve problems in multiple cycles; replicate experiments
3. Discovery: Engage in research tasks that have unknown outcomes
4. Authenticity: Engage in innovation and collaboration to address original research questions, and do authentic scientific tasks
5. Ownership: Develop a sense of responsibility for and personal connection to the research
6. Relevance: Apply the outcomes and applications of scientific discoveries to real world-contexts, or ask questions with scientific relevance.

## Scientific Teaching in Practice

Scientific teaching offers a natural structure for teaching that parallels scientific research, as well as the scientific practices we are asking our students to learn. Teaching science can mimic science practices in many ways.

- **Science practices:** Both researchers and instructors can develop and use models, plan and carry out investigations, analyze and interpret data, engage in scientific arguments and construct explanations.
- **Iteration:** Instructors can identify problems, improve materials, and repeat the process to resolution.
- **Discovery:** Engaging in scholarship of teaching and learning allows instructors to propose hypotheses and make inquiries.
- **Authenticity and Ownership:** Instructors also engage in innovation and collaboration, build on previous knowledge, gain agency, and develop a sense of responsibility for outcomes.
- **Relevance:** Instructors can share their findings with others and work on education reform that has applications beyond their own classroom.

The Scientific Teaching Course is designed to help you put all these ideas into practice. It provides an overview of the complex and expansive landscape of evidence, approaches, methods, and theories. It also highlights the role of systemic barriers in learning environments and provides tools to remove them.

Our aim is to empower you, the instructor, to customize the approaches for your own identities, students, content, and contexts.

### Organization of the Scientific Teaching Course

This course is organized around interactive modules that provide guidelines, reflective moments, hands-on practice, and immediate application. The modules build on and reinforce each other:

- **Scientific Teaching** explains why change is needed and lays a foundation of evidence-based theories.
- **Inclusive Learning** provides a deeper dive into theories and practices for equitable learning.
- The modules on **Course Design, Learning Experiences, Summative Assessment,** and **Course Structure** turn theory into actionable practice.
- **Scientific Teaching Revisited** offers suggestions for lifelong learning and iterative improvement as a scientific teacher.
