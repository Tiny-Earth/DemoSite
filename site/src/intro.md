## Scientific Teaching Defined

Scientific teaching is both the *teaching of science* and the *science of teaching*. An instructor who practices scientific teaching:

- Engages students in authentic practices of science
- Approaches their teaching with the spirit of scientific research

Scientific teaching combines intentional instructional decisions with iterative improvements to create inclusive learning experiences, which, in turn, support students learning science.

## Goals of Scientific Teaching

The goals of scientific teaching are to:

- Infuse scientific thinking into teaching and learning.
- Increase diversity in STEM.

Embedded in this undertaking is a challenge to all scientists to bring to teaching the critical thinking, rigor, creativity, and spirit of experimentation that defines research (Handelsman et al., 2004).

Scientific teaching also posits that teaching science should capture the spirit of discovery in the classroom in ways that are accessible to all students. Teaching scientifically supports student learning, brings joy to teaching, and leads to increased diversity in STEM.
