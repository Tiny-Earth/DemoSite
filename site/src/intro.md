## Scientific Teaching Defined

Scientific teaching is both the *teaching of science* and the *science of teaching*. An instructor who practices scientific teaching:

- Engages students in authentic practices of science
- Approaches their teaching with the spirit of scientific research

Scientific teaching combines intentional instructional decisions with iterative improvements to create inclusive learning experiences, which, in turn, support students learning science.

### Goals of Scientific Teaching

*The goals of scientific teaching are infuse scientific thinking into teaching and learning and increase diversity in STEM.*

Embedded in this undertaking is the challenge to all scientists to bring to teaching the critical thinking, rigor, creativity, and spirit of experimentation that defines research [handelsman_scientific_2004](@cite). Scientific teaching also posits that teaching science should capture the spirit of discovery in the classroom in ways that are accessible to all students. Teaching scientifically supports student learning, brings joy to teaching, and leads to increased diversity in STEM.

### Effective Science Education

*Effective science education is equitable science education.*

```@raw html
<!--
TODO From Becca:

I'm not quite convinced of the framing of opportunity gaps (see Shukla et al 2022,
https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.21-05-0130). It's still framing comparisons
around a white male control group...
-->
```

Scientific teaching is needed because inequities plague higher education and affect STEM workforce diversity.

Opportunity gaps between overrepresented and underrepresented students have been called “one of the most urgent and intractable problems in higher education” (Bensimon, 2005, p. 99).

Increasing diversity in STEM requires drawing from historically excluded groups of people. The future workforce should match the demographics of the world’s citizens, take advantage of underutilized talent in all demographic groups, and make STEM careers readily available to people of all backgrounds.

Yet inequities in college science education continue to deny opportunities to students who identify as members of underrepresented racial or ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQIA2S+, or first-generation in college. Collectively, we refer to these and other underrepresented groups as historically excluded communities (HECs) with respect to STEM.

To achieve an equitable STEM workforce, we must address the structural, individual, intentional, and unintentional biases that discourage HEC students from pursuing STEM.

### What the US Reports Say about Science Education

For decades, numerous reports have called for science education reform, citing overwhelming evidence that effective and equitable science education requires widespread adoption of evidence-based practices. Highlights of these evolving arguments include:

```@raw html
<!-- TODO what are the full citations used in the points below? -->
```

- *Science for All Americans* (American Association for the Advancement of Science [AAAS], 1989) called for a scientifically literate public and charged higher educators with teaching scientific “habits of mind.” The report noted that employers demanded efficient and effective employees with problem-solving capabilities, the ability to work in teams, and analytical skills, yet students were unprepared for these demands.
- *Bio2010* (National Research Council, 2003) recommended that science curriculum should reflect the nature of science as a dynamic, interdisciplinary, and rapidly changing frontier, rather than a static body of facts.
- *Vision and Change* (AAAS 2008; 2011) furthered the Bio2010 recommendations by enumerating key biology concepts and science skills, encouraging teaching practices that focused on these concepts and skills, and calling for more research in STEM higher education.
- *Engage to Excel* (PCAST, 2012) illuminated national STEM workforce shortages, including racial and gender disparities. The report purported that addressing these weaknesses required improving undergraduate STEM education. The report recommended widespread adoption of active learning strategies and undergraduate research experiences, citing dozens of studies demonstrating their effectiveness.
- *Indicators for Monitoring Undergraduate STEM Education*, a National Academies report, reinforced goals for improving the quality and impact of undergraduate STEM education [dibner2018indicators](@cite) by engaging students in evidence-based educational practices. They broadened the call to strive for inclusion by providing equitable access to STEM opportunities.
- Levers for Change (AAAS, 2019) noted that the benefits of active learning extended beyond knowledge and skills to include “attitudes, sense of belonging, and persistence in STEM” and again pleaded for widespread adoption of evidence-based strategies to support students.

Despite these findings, 70% of instructors reported extensive use of lecturing in their courses, rather than evidence-based instructional strategies (AAAS, 2019; [stains_anatomy_2018](@cite)). One of the main reasons for not using these practices is obvious: Instructors need to know about them in order to use them—preferably with a chance to practice and reflect.

### STEM has an Equity Problem

The problem of not using evidence-based practices is compounded when we ignore the role of systemic inequities in US higher education, where underrepresentation in STEM is prevalent [TK need #s, citation].

The lack of representation of HEC students can be largely attributed to STEM attrition during college. More than half of the approximately 600,000 college students who intend to major in STEM switch to other fields. For example, a disheartening 42% of white students leave STEM majors, but the problem is much worse for students of color: 58% of Latine students and 66% of Black students leave STEM (Theobald et al., 2020). These disparities repeat again and again across most HEC groups: first-generation and rural students, women, queer folks—the list goes on.

Why do students leave? In extensive interviews of college students enrolled in STEM majors, 90% mentioned ineffective teaching approaches (Seymour, 2019). The good news is that we can learn how to change our teaching, which can have immediate and lasting positive effects for our students. *The STC focuses on what instructors have agency to change: course design and the classroom environment.*

    #### Reflect on your teaching

    How much of your course is based on evidence-based teaching practices?  


### Effective Science

*Effective science is inclusive science.*

Scientific teaching is needed because science is a critical component of our world. Teaching science in a way that reflects how science is done equips the students we teach today to ask and answer the scientific questions of tomorrow. The rapid expansion of scientific knowledge means students will need to solve global problems and navigate the difference between evidence-based claims and opinions. Whether they major in biology, art history, math, or elementary education, college-educated students should understand the basic principles of the world around them. Equally important, students need to appreciate the origins of scientific information, think critically about new problems and situations, and sustain a lifelong curiosity about the world around them.

Scientific teaching is also needed because diversity impacts science. Teaching science authentically can also broaden participation in STEM. When students actively engage in scientific practices, they develop a more robust scientific self-efficacy and identity [estrada_toward_2011](@cite). When students witness diverse scientist identities and engage in solving real-world problems, they connect with and envision themselves as part of the scientific community [ref spotlight scientist]. These factors—positive self-efficacy, identity, and connection with scientific values—lead to increased persistence in STEM, especially for students from communities that have been historically excluded [estrada_toward_2011](@cite). Broadening participation in STEM is essential for asking meaningful questions, addressing inequities, and ensuring that STEM benefits everyone.

### Effective Teaching

*Effective teaching helps students develop science skills.*

Authentically integrating science into teaching requires moving beyond a mindset of “covering the content” toward designing experiences in which students “uncover the content” and actively develop the essential knowledge, skills, and mindsets that align with how science is practiced.

Instructors who identify overarching concepts and broad themes can help students to organize complex information and deepen their understanding. They also help students integrate scientific knowledge with authentic practices and account for students' diverse identities, beliefs, and experiences. This shift doesn’t mean students don’t learn facts; it means they learn how to organize these facts and apply what they have learned in authentic contexts.

*Effective teaching is intentional, inclusive, and iterative.*

Effective teaching creates learning experiences for students to engage in doing science—more on that in upcoming modules. Effective teaching also means approaching your teaching with the same rigor and spirit of your scientific research. This involves being intentional, inclusive, and iterative.

Scientific teaching aims to bring a philosophy and framework to teaching that makes the process more rigorous, reflective, and evaluative. Drawing from discovery and evidence-based strategies, scientific teaching provides a model for teaching that parallels science research. Rather than allowing a haphazard approach to designing daily lectures, scientific teaching emphasizes intentional course-level planning, using empirical evidence and data to inform instructional decisions. This approach allows courses to evolve over time using student learning as the driving evidence.

Like science, these teaching principles take time to practice and implement. Also like science, we advocate that you select from practices that demonstrate positive student outcomes and carefully evaluate which approaches will work best in your context.

## A Framework for Scientific Teaching

The main framework for scientific teaching is the process of science itself: how we ask and answer questions and what questions are explored. Most of us are familiar with the scientific method, which asks us to make an observation, develop a hypothesis, design an experiment, collect and analyze data, and summarize findings. However, anyone who engages with science knows there is more to science than experimentation. The six facets of science expand to include other hallmarks of research and discovery, contextualized for undergraduate STEM education. The facets below are largely derived from the literature around undergraduate research [ref NAP, Dolan etc] and provide a framework for engaging students in scientific inquiry through the courses that we teach.

### The Facets of Science

![Illustration of the six facets of science: Science practices, iteration, discovery, authenticity, ownership, and relevance](assets/six-facets-of-science.svg)

The six facets of science include:

- **Science Practices:** Ask questions, generate hypotheses, carry out investigations, analyze and communicate data
- **Iteration:** Identify and resolve problems in multiple cycles; replicate experiments
- **Discovery:** Engage in research tasks that have unknown outcomes
- **Authenticity:** Engage in innovation and collaboration to address original research questions and do authentic scientific tasks
- **Ownership:** Develop a sense of responsibility for and personal connection to the research
- **Relevance:** Apply the outcomes and applications of scientific discoveries to real world-contexts, or ask questions relevant to the researcher

## Scientific Teaching in Practice

Scientific teaching offers a natural structure for teaching that parallels scientific research, as well as the scientific practices we are asking our students to learn. Teaching science can mimic science practices in many ways.

- **Science Practices:** Both researchers and instructors can develop and use models, plan and carry out investigations, analyze and interpret data, engage in scientific arguments and construct explanations.
- **Iteration:** Instructors can also replicate and troubleshoot experiments and resolve problems.
- **Discovery:** Engaging in educational research allows instructors to propose hypotheses and make inquiries.
- **Authenticity and Ownership:** Instructors also engage in innovation and collaboration, build on previous knowledge, gain agency, and develop a sense of responsibility for outcomes.
- **Relevance:** Finally, instructors can share their findings with others and work on education reform that has application beyond their own classroom.

### A Path to Scientific Teaching

The Scientific Teaching Course is designed to help you put all these ideas into practice. It provides an overview of the complex and expansive landscape of evidence, approaches, methods, and theories. It also highlights the role of systemic barriers in learning environments and provides tools to remove them. Our aim is to empower you, the instructor, to customize the approaches for your own identities, students, content, and contexts.
This course is organized around interactive modules that provide guidelines, reflective moments, hands-on practice, and immediate application. The modules build on and reinforce each other:

- **Scientific Teaching** explains why change is needed and lays a foundation of evidence-based theories.
- **Inclusive Learning** provides a deeper dive into theories and practices for equitable learning.
- **Course Design**, **Learning Experiences**, **Summative Assessment**, and **Course Structure** turn theory into actionable practice.
- **Scientific Teaching Revisited** offers suggestions for lifelong learning and iterative improvement as a scientific teacher.
