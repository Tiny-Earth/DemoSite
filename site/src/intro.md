## Scientific Teaching Defined

Scientific teaching is both the *teaching of science* and the *science of teaching*. An instructor who practices scientific teaching:

- Engages students in authentic practices of science
- Approaches their teaching with the spirit of scientific research

Scientific teaching combines intentional instructional decisions with iterative improvements to create inclusive learning experiences, which, in turn, support students learning science.

## Goals of Scientific Teaching

The goals of scientific teaching are to:

- Infuse scientific thinking into teaching and learning.
- Increase diversity in STEM.

Embedded in this undertaking is a challenge to all scientists to bring to teaching the critical thinking, rigor, creativity, and spirit of experimentation that defines research (Handelsman et al., 2004).

Scientific teaching also posits that teaching science should capture the spirit of discovery in the classroom in ways that are accessible to all students. Teaching scientifically supports student learning, brings joy to teaching, and leads to increased diversity in STEM.

## Why Scientific Teaching?

### Effective Science Education

<mark>*Effective science education is equitable science education.* </mark>

Scientific teaching is needed to create a diverse and creative workforce equipped to address emerging global and local problems.Increasing diversity in STEM requires drawing from historically excluded groups. The future workforce should match the demographics of the world’s citizens, take advantage of underutilized talent in all demographic groups, and make STEM careers readily available to people of all backgrounds.

Yet inequities plague higher education, quelling STEM workforce diversity. Opportunity gaps between overrepresented and underrepresented students have been called “one of the most urgent and intractable problems in higher education” (Bensimon, 2005, p. 99). The inequities in college science education continue to deny opportunities to historically excluded communities (HECs): groups and individuals who have traditionally been underrepresented and denied full rights, privileges, and participantion in STEM education. HECs include but are not limited to women, people of color, caregivers, LGBTQIA+ students, first-generation students, and low-income students (Asai, 2020).

To achieve an equitable STEM workforce, we must address the structural, individual, intentional, and unintentional biases that:
- Discourage HEC students from pursuing STEM
- Limit professors, departments, and institutions from actively working toward challenging systematic inequalities
- Obscure “opportunities for all faculty and all students to analyze power and privilege in classrooms, in peer groups, in departments, in disciplines, in institutions, and in society” (Chikkatur and Valle, 2023)

## What the US Reports Say about Science Education

For decades, numerous reports have called for science education reform, citing overwhelming evidence that effective and equitable science education requires widespread adoption of evidence-based practices. Highlights of these evolving arguments include:

- Science for All Americans (American Association for the Advancement of Science [AAAS], 1989) called for a scientifically literate public and charged higher educators with teaching scientific “habits of mind.” The report noted that employers demanded efficient and effective employees with problem-solving capabilities, the ability to work in teams, and analytical skills, yet students were unprepared for these demands.
- Bio2010 (National Research Council, 2003) recommended that science curriculum should reflect the nature of science as a dynamic, interdisciplinary, and rapidly changing frontier, rather than a static body of facts.
- Vision and Change (AAAS 2008; 2011) furthered the Bio2010 recommendations by enumerating key biology concepts and science skills, encouraging teaching practices that focused on these concepts and skills, and calling for more research in STEM higher education. 
- Engage to Excel (PCAST, 2012) illuminated national STEM workforce shortages, including racial and gender disparities. The report purported that addressing these weaknesses required improving undergraduate STEM education. The report recommended widespread adoption of active learning strategies and undergraduate research experiences, citing dozens of studies demonstrating their effectiveness.
- Indicators for Monitoring Undergraduate STEM Education, a National Academies report, reinforced goals for improving the quality and impact of undergraduate STEM education (Dibner et al., 2018) by engaging students in evidence-based educational practices. They broadened the call to strive for inclusion by providing equitable access to STEM opportunities.
- Levers for Change (AAAS, 2019) noted that the benefits of active learning extended beyond knowledge and skills to include “attitudes, sense of belonging, and persistence in STEM” and again pleaded for widespread adoption of evidence-based strategies to support students.

Despite these findings, 70% of instructors have reported extensive use of lecturing in their courses, rather than evidence-based instructional strategies (AAAS, 2019; Stains et al., 2018), citing the absence of formal pedagogical training as one of the main reasons (Walczyk et al, 2006). The good news is that faculty who receive pedagogical training are more likely to seek innovative teaching methods and implement learner-centered practices (Marsh & Hattie, 2002; Walczyk & Ramsey, 2003).

## STEM has an Equity Problem 

The problem of not using evidence-based practices is compounded when we ignore the role of systemic inequities in US higher education, where underrepresentation in STEM is prevalent. 
More than half of the approximately 600,000 college students who intend to major in STEM switch to other fields (Thiry et al., 2019; Handelsman et al., 2022).

Although a disheartening 42% of white students leave STEM majors, the problem is much worse for students of color: 58% of Latine students and 66% of Black students leave STEM (Riegle-Crumb et al., 2019).

The differential pattern of exclusion from STEM affects students not only according to race and ethnicity; talented college students from HECs also leave at higher rates (Thiry et al., 2019).

Most of those who leave a STEM major have the interest, confidence, and aptitude to be successful in STEM, but early classroom experiences can dampen their interest and actively exclude them from persisting (Thiry et al., 2019; Estrada et al., 2019). Their departures after gateway STEM courses represent a major talent drain from the system. To achieve an equitable educational enterprise, we must address the structural, individual, intentional, and unintentional biases that discourage HEC students from pursuing STEM.

Therefore, this Scientific Teaching Course focuses on what instructors have agency to change: course design and the classroom environment.

## Effective Science

<mark>*Effective science is inclusive science.*</mark>

To answer the increasingly complex science questions of the future, we need to ensure that students develop a working understanding of how science is done. The rapid expansion of scientific knowledge means students need to be prepared to solve global problems and navigate the difference between evidence-based claims and opinions. Whether they major in biology, art history, math, or elementary education, college-educated students should understand the basic principles of the world around them. When students actively engage in scientific practices, they develop a more robust scientific self-efficacy and identity (Estrada et al., 2011). Equally important, students need to appreciate the origins of scientific information, think critically about new problems and situations, and sustain a lifelong curiosity about the world around them.

Diversity within the scientific community supports the broadening of participation in STEM fields.  When students witness diverse scientist identities and engage in solving real-world problems, they connect with and envision themselves as part of the scientific community [ref]. 

These factors—positive self-efficacy, identity, and connection with scientific values—lead to increased persistence in STEM, especially for students from communities that have been historically excluded (Estrada et al., 2011). Broadening participation in STEM is essential for asking meaningful questions, addressing inequities, and ensuring that STEM benefits everyone.
